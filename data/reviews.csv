B0CL5KNB9M,Fives No Jive,A longtime PlayStation fan I had been putting off getting a PS5 until the three following milestones occurred  1 a reduction in size of the console 2 a reduction in the price of the console 3 a reduction in the price of games for the console  I thought that the introduction of the PS5 Slim last fall would spur my purchase but Sony didnt cut the price and even older PS5 games were still selling for 70  But finally during the Days of Play event this spring Sony knocked 50 off the consoles price  I didnt want the Spiderman or COD bundles not my favorite games  and I decided to act  Four years is a LONG time to wait to play a new RC title after all  So here are my thoughts on the PS5 now thats in my house  1 Setup is remarkably easy including wirelessly transferring game save information from a PS4 It did take me a while to figure out how to turn off the female voice heralding all my actions under Accessibility options  2 The PS5 runs like a champ So far I have not been aware of any fan noises or clouds of warm air exhaust spewing out  3 The DualSense controllers had weaker rumble than I expected It turns out that the rumble motors default to the weak setting if you have the controllers microphone enabled I turned off the mike and the rumble was back at full force but with more finesse than that experienced with the PS4s DUALSHOCK controllers If Im not mistaken the precision of the DS controller actually seems to improve my game scores  4 The new user interface is kind of a mess In particular leaving the POWER button off the Home page was a boneheaded move One of my first issues with the new console was  how do I turn this bloody beast OFF I wish that the controller battery gauge was on the Home page as well  5 It was a brilliant idea making the disk drive detachable The one problem I had with my PS4 involved the machines failure to read disks after a few years which I am guessing was an issue of a dirty reading head I sent the console to Sony to be fixed and it came back working perfectly in one week Now I assume I can just repair or replace the removable drive without sending in the entire console for repair  6 Now that the PS5 packs 1 TB of memory I was wondering how soon I would need to add more memory Currently I have plenty of memory to switch back and forth between a number of games including Ratchet  Clank Rift Apart plus several from the PS4 including WRC Generations Far Cry 6 and Resident Evil 4 as well as the Pinball Arcade One good reason I wanted the disk version of the PS5 was to minimize the size of game downloads to preserve memory  7 The audiovideo performance of the PS5 to play back DVDs and BluRays is outstanding And I was happy to find that the excellent Bluetooth PDP media controller I got for the PS4 works with the PS5 as well Yea  that made me feel better about spending 30 for the PS5s vertical stand instead  8 And some of the PS5 titles are FINALLY coming down in price Rift Apart and the latest Star Wars game for example  two AAA titles  are now available for a far more affordable 30  So if you have been putting off upgrading to a PS5 it may be time at last to make the move provided you can catch a special promotion  And to those who say Game consoles days are numbered I say  as long as many of us prefer to play games sitting on a couch enveloped in booming 3D sound and watching our dazzling bigscreen TVs   long live PlayStation consoles  especially those that serve as a 2in1 machine with builtin or detachable disk drives that also play DVDs and BRs,5,551 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2024",True

B0CFPJYX7P,Sharp and by far the best,This version of Kindle Paperwhite is by far the BEST Ive seen to date Its available in Rasberry AKA Pink lets start there The color is cute I was sold at the color OKAY Other nice things about this device The screen and images from the books appear sharper and that impressed me The warm light settings are a favorite of mine because my reading experience is much easier on the eye Dark mode is win too but I typically use that at night The page turn and Kindle Store experience is much faster compared to the Agave Paperwhite My downloads dont lag and that is GREAT because Im always shopping for NEW books The 7 screen feels relatively lightweight however I use a case and pop socket most of the time I have too many books AND access to ALL at my fingertips and I dont worry about storage capacity Of all the Kindles this one is my favorite,5,4 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2024",True
B0CFPJYX7P,Is it worth upgrading  Unfortunately Yes a very resounding yes,Ive had my Kindle since 2013 Ive probably read over 1000 books on this little piece of equipment over the past 11 years as its been the most convenient piece of electronics Ive carried with me on my travels  I originally bought my Kindle to replace a Sony ereader I had because the glare on the Sony version made it impossible to use outside and in brightly lit rooms upgrading to Amazons Kindle was a huge game changer for me  Ive been resistant to upgrading my Kindle for the past 5 years because why would I My 2013 Kindle still works quite well the battery life is very long and sure I need to reboot it every few weeks otherwise its too slow to use and yes it has issues connecting to my wifi every other month  These were minor inconveniences that didnt seem to be worth fixing for 150  Well I received my new Kindle Paperwhite yesterday and my first thought was  wow this is a lot lighter  Then I turned it on and I was sold  Lightening fast responsive warmer backlight larger screen and significantly improved contrast for sharper letters  When I bought my first ereader in 2011 Sony I had to turn it off during take off and landing Weve come a long way since then and we know that an ereader and other small personal electronics dont impact airplane instruments and you can read away nonstop on flights  If youre putting off upgrading an old Kindle and you have the money to do so dont wait this Kindle is far superior to models made over a decade ago and if you havent done so connect your Kindle to your local library for essentially an unlimited supply of free reading material,5,186 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2024",True
B0CFPJYX7P,Tons of issues including horrible Amazon service,I have owned every Kindle starting from 2014 when I got the Voyage Right off the bat the new Kindle Paperwhite has an overly yellow screen meaning that the light is significantly yellow Its not white its not even subtly opaque But YELLOW This is confirmed across multiple websites including YouTube and Amazon reviews on here  The other issue is that all new Kindles no longer support Apple computers due to the new MTP format that the Kindles are using This means that you have to go through the hassle of downloading a thirdparty application to do simple things like update new software and sideload fonts  Which leads me to my next issue sideloaded fonts are no longer properly supported You can still sideload fonts BUT every time you open a new book it automatically defaults to the Bookerly font even though you have saved a certain font setting This is extremely annoying  The next issue is that you can no longer download and transfer a book through the content settings on the Amazon website with new Kindles If you want to download a book that you have purchased Amazon has eliminated the ability for you to do that WHY Amazon service has no answers regarding this  Needless to say I returned this device for all of the stated reasons and guess what Amazon is going to take 30 DAYS to refund me my money I have to wait 30 DAYS to get my money back because Amazon has a defective and unsatisfactory faulty device Next time if I ever purchase another Kindle it will not be through Amazon But yet if new Kindles are this bad why bother  Now lets talk about aesthetics and design It seems Amazon is going backwards in their hardware The voyage was released 10 years ago in 2014 and if you were to compare them sidebyside one would think that the Voyage is the brand new model Aside from the having micro USB the Voyage has a sleeker more premium look with page turn sensors and better materials with a micro etched glass screen instead of plastic It also has a curved symmetrical design for better feel as opposed to a basic slab like the new Paperwhite  Lastly Amazon has done absolutely NOTHING to improve their software You still have the same limitations that you did since day one Kindles have the same limited margin settings limited font size settings and limited linespacing settings  I have a lot of sideloaded fonts that I would like to use but am unable to because theyre either too big or too small with the slightest increment in size adjustment Absolutely ridiculous Also the boldness options are too thick with slightest adjustment a font will go from too thin to too bold A total joke  GIVE US MORE FONT SIZES and OPTIONS AMAZON  My Advice  Im gonna give you my honest and most sincere advice regarding these new kindles STAY AWAY They are a disaster If you have the previous Kindle Paperwhite stick to that It is much better These new Paperwhites are defective From the yellow screens to the poor quality control to the font bugs to the MTP format its just not worth it The quality control is so bad that buying a new Kindle is like playing the lottery you most likely will lose and get a defective device with uneven poor lighting and heres the rub Amazon now has the most atrocious return policy in the industry I dont say that lightly it is absolutely despicable what the return process is like I couldnt even take the return to a local Kohls UPS store or a Staples store I had to take a day off from work because the only option Amazon gave me was to wait for a UPS driver to pick up my Kindle return at my house Insanity Talk about extreme inconvenience Then and here me outIt took 29 days from the day I initiated the return until the day it actually reached my bank account to get my refund 29 Days And I have been a prime member since 2008 This is how they treat their members What other business does that Nobody  If you absolutely must take a chance on these new Kindles then by all means go to your local electronic department store and purchase it there Because when you most likely get a defective Paperwhite you can at least go back to the store and return it and get your money back immediately  Lastly A word of Caution  I have a lot of books that I purchased from other websites and for the past 10 years I havent had any issues sideloading those books onto my Kindles BUT for the past year Amazon is making it very difficult to add sideloaded books onto your Kindle What I mean is that you can still sideload books via an application like Calibre or Send to Kindle but you have to keep your Kindle in airplane mode The moment you take your Kindle off of airplane mode Amazon will automatically and mischievously delete ALL of your sideloaded books on your Kindle YES you heard that right Amazon WILL delete your sideloaded books that are not purchased through Amazon once you connect your Kindle to WiFi This happens automatically To prove this you can go into your Kindle hard drive on a computer and you will see that the book file no longer exists for that particular book Other companies do not do this but Amazon is now doing it and its been going on for a year Its a known issue  all over the internet simply Google it and Amazon does nothing about it My guess is that they want you to purchase all of your content on Amazon They do not want competition Heed this advice because if you have a lot of of sideloaded books youre better off using another eBook Reader such as Kobo or Onyx,1,252 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United

B0CFPJYX7P,Perfect little carryalong,Im a relatively new eink convert having bought a trickedout Kindle Scribe exactly two years ago when the device was brand new Long story short I loved that device Literally to death After dropping it on terrazzo floors in SEVERAL airports worldwide not to mention the myriad spills at home on more forgiving carpet In fact I loved it so much that when the 11th gen Scribe went on firesale a few weeks ago I bought the cheapest version to replace my original recently nonfunctional unit simply swapping my old premium pen for the basic one Clearly I loved the device enough to buy it again I adore the ability to mark up pdfs the notetaking capabilities and that even with this extra functionality its still a very limited device that allows me to focus on reading first  What I dont love and never have The weight Its heavy to the point that I never used it if I couldnt prop it on something Which led to it being dropped A lot Which led to the original unit failing Not that it wasnt pretty sturdy I mean it survived repeated collisions with very unforgiving surfaces It even weathered some relatively large liquid spills on and near it despite not being water resistant  Now I just use the Scribe when I need to mark up pdfs like when Im gaming I can keep my character sheets on the Kindle or need something that can display larger printed materials Like RPG basic books or comics  Hence the new Kindle Paperwhite gen 12  My new device isnt appreciably different than my Scribe except in a couple very important ways The reviews dont lie The screen contrast is higher and in good light without backlighting looks whiter The device is much smaller and seems a touch slimmer Its also very importantly less than half as heavy which means its comfortable to hold in one hand while reading without tiring I dont need to set it down on things or prop it up which reduces the threat of drops When Im out in public I do have a cover for the device and because its so light you can hold it open like a paperback and it wont overbalance and fall out of your hand The screen given that its half the size of the Scribe seems to refresh much faster It also seems to load the store faster and settings menu navigation is measurably faster as well This is not surprising The device is newer and has less functionality The one thing that I have detracted a star for is the battery life I dont use the pen on the Scribe unless Im actually writing as it drains battery quickly When youre turning pages with the touchscreen however you get exceptional battery life out of the Scribe Not so terribly much on the Paperwhite Granted Im not the average reader 30 minutes a day is amateurish When I use the backlight all day Im running down the battery at least 10 on the Paperwhite if not more Not a dealbreaker by any means but gone are the days of not bringing a charging cord for a two week vacation as I did with the Scribe  I hear a lot of people make noise about the format AKA the Paperwhite doesnt have the extended lip on the side like the Oasis to make it easier to hold and that it doesnt have buttons Well I understand that personal preference is personal preference but Who the heck wants another point of mechanical failure on a device that goes through a lot of punishment in public I dont want my precious pageturn button breaking Ever And lets face it Thats why everything is touchscreen these days Yes you might have to clean the screen more often or bother to wash your hands before using your precious device which you really SHOULD be doing anyway but these arent exactly dealbreakers Another thing thats come up even in professional reviews is people accidentally activating the bottom button The question I have is HOW You need to alter your grip for leverage to depress it the device is so light The only other thing Ive mused on is that the Paperwhite is just a plain plastic thing It doesnt have the flashy aluminum backside of the Oasis or even the Scribe It doesnt look as luxe in the hand And honestly After the durability and weight issues Ive mentioned above I just plain dont care If Im in public my device is in a case anyway Im not an Apple person While I experience SOME evanity I dont think of my Kindle as a fashion accessory Rather the opposite as some people judge one harshly for going with an Amazon device in the first place Im here to read and you probably are too if youre bothering to read this review  All in all it took less than a week for the Paperwhite to become my favored reading device for its portability its weight and its utility I love the tiny thing I look forward to years of carefree comfortable reading without worrying so much about dropping my favorite notetaking device and general scratchpad the Scribe,4,58 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024",True

B0CFPJYX7P,Wondering Why I Waited So Long To Upgrade,I have a Kindle from 2014 which works just fine so every year when the newer version goes on sale I just convince myself to not spend the money to upgrade since this one still works albeit a little slowly in its older age Well this year I decided to finally just do it  mainly because my cover was falling apart on my old one but I figured if I have to buy a new cover then I will just go ahead and buy a new Kindle  I just got this in the mail a few days ago and I am in love I mean like over the moon sliding down a rainbow in love for so many reasons most importantly for all of the adventures it holds My future is so much brighter now because I am going to go to so many places through the books in my brand new Paperwhite I am SO excited Ive downloaded lots of new books just so I can curl up under a blanket cause its cold outside and use it more  It is beautiful I got the pink one decided to make it uniquely mine and bought an antique brown Fintie cover because those two colors go well together The case is perfect I highly recommend it because it has a foldover velcro side to keep your Kindle Paperwhite solidly secure so it wont slip out  I have attached a photo of both my Kindle Paperwhites side by side so you can see the difference in size The newer one is bigger but not bulky feeling Its lightning fast which is super awesome I didnt realize how slow my other Kindle was until I got this one So far I have to say that is my favorite thing about this one I dont find too much difference in the lighting from the previous version but maybe you will No comment on the waterproof claim because I will never ever have any of my electronics near water Learned that in Kindergarten  FYI if youre doing a tradein The 20 percent discount will not apply to your order if you choose the option with 3 months free Kindle Unlimited You have to buy the device only then purchase that separately Took me a bit to figure that out but a 20 percent discount is pretty good when you take it off the sale price Plus the 5 gift card doesnt seem like much but add it to the discount and it works out pretty well for a great new device The discount and gift card are applied to your account as soon as you submit the tradein request You dont have to wait to buy your new Kindle while your old one is making its way through the mail  I just love this I highly recommend buying it if youre thinking about it Happy reading,5,8 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2024",True
B0CFPJYX7P,A few quirks but still great,I should preface this by saying this Kindle is my third paperwhite Ive also had the Fire and a regular Kindle before that and my Kindle is in my top 5 of my beloved possessions  However Im a bit frustrated with the setup on this one Some of this is operator error  Ive been trying to download too many books at a time which keeps freezing up the system So thats on me and why this version currently gets 4 stars instead of 3 But when I first registered my device which went smoothly and then opened up my library I discovered all but a handful of my books of which I have well over 2000 were showing up as unread or partially read even though I currently only have 2 unread books At first I hoped that the system would catch up this was prior to me downloading books onto the new Kindle as my content library on Amazon showed the books correctly marked as read but that didnt seem to happen so I manually went through and marked them all as read To be fair I found a few errors in my organizing in doing this so was able to fix a few things Still it was a frustration and time consuming I should note that I did check for and ran the update when I first started the Kindle too  After two restarts to unfreeze the Kindle again probably my fault from trying to download too many books at once plus a third one when the screen suddenly prompted me to register my device again after having already done it and having 775 books already downloaded I am going much more slowly on downloading so hopefully the rest of the process will finally go more smoothly  One other quirk was a couple books that had been placed in collections suddenly showed up in the uncollected folder Not sure if I somehow accidentally removed them from their collections dont see how though or what was going on  Oh one other quirk I nearly forgot was that my library was showing that I had 42 library books even though all had been long returned So I also had to rereturn them as part of the process of getting this Kindle ready to use  Im guessing this next concern is because it was trying to download books last night but it was fully charged at around midnight and when I checked it about 8am this morning it was down to 7 battery charge  Im hopeful all will be fine when all is said and done but what I thought was going to be an hour long process is well into the double digits of hours with work left to be done Ah well Im sure once its all done and I can focus on reading this frustration will simply be an unpleasant memory  Update All is forgiven with the above noted issues as it is easier to use the screen is nice sized so easier to readjust wonderful,4,8 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024",True

B0D6VGWTYW,If you have wavy frizzy hair,I have had this product for 6 months or so Ive used to every single time after I wash my hair  This product has definitely been life changing but my hair type makes it difficult to get the best results I dont get the shiny sleek look that everyone wants I still have some frizz but it reduced it a lot  I love all the attachments they include Unfortunately I barely use the barrels for curls In order to get good curls you have to straighten your hair or it will be a mess I have a difficult time  straightening my hair when using the attachments So you might need a straighter if you want the best optimal curls  Keep in mind I need to get better with it and Im learning Im getting better with them and each time Ive reduced my time a lot Its a really good product with learning curve Its easy to use once you get the hang of it Its lightweight which is a big plus If you have hair like mine it will still look a bit frizzy  When it comes to value I dont regret spending the money I used to buy this I love it I look forward to washing my hair because of this product,4,113 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2024",True
B0D6VGWTYW,Not fully sold,Used this with the large round brush attachment for the first time today Normally it takes me 40mins to blow dry my hair with the Revlon brush It took me the same exact amount of time to do it with the Airwrap The pros I will say are that its very light so it not as tiresome for me who has very thick curly hair The other pro is that because its light weight the back of my hair which I save for the end looks nicer The cons is the price so far that one thing isnt worth the amount of money Looking forward to trying again to see how long it will take the next time and the health of my hair the the coming months I also think that for the price the box should have been like a tabletop attachment holder or something Everything inside is black paper I have to buy a carrying case separate,3,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024",True

B0CLF3VPMV,Good basic tablet,This is my third Samsung A tablet  I have found them to be an excellent value for basic use  reading web surfing media playback and lightweight games  I specifically do not use it as a laptop replacement or for hardcore gaming  The 11 screen is of an adequate size and the brightness and clarity are perfect for indoor use  Mine has 128GB storage which has the more useful upgrade of 8 GB RAM which makes loading multiple programs much quicker  There is a SD slot where you can add up to 1 TB if you require it The subjective speed of the A9 is a little quicker than my older A8  One useful throwback feature is that it has a real headphone jack if you happen to have a quality set of older headphones  The builtin speakers are better than I would have thought  they are quite clear but there is still no appreciable bass Idle time battery life is somewhat less than I would have thought but this unit is still new and I havent gone through that many charge cycles to sort out what is going on  If you run the battery pretty far down it can take a while to charge  about 4 hours from 10 to 100 using a Samsung phone charger,5,253 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024",True
B0CLF3VPMV,First time Tablet user,Ive been a computer user for many years not an expert though and I own a Samsung smart phone and laptop so Im not a novice to technology but I am for a tablet It comes with a lot of bloatware easily removed and I was able to easily pair my phone settings to the tablet wirelessly  no problem Havent tried using the tablet as a phone yet but I probably will in the future just because it would be handy bedside So far I have enjoyed it but I am disappointed that Samsung has sooooo many updates that consume a lot of time I knew there would be a lot of updates when I first turned it on but several days in I can still expect a Samsung update almost on a daily basis and this is after Ive done all the customizing that I want Drives me nuts so I encourage any new user to take advantage of being able to NOT do auto updates or youll be without use of the tablet which can be very exasperating and circumvents the desire to quickly search for something  Do them on command or schedule them  Samsung  get with it and bundle updates so they are less frequent albeit more time consuming for each one Other than that apps load quickly and the display is crisp and clear and the sound is very good as are response times when moving from app to app or screen to screen The battery life has been very good so far and seems better than my cell phone One thing I dont understand is why Samsung has offset the search bar on the home screenit is off center to the left on the screen no matter how I turn the device Not a deal breaker but just looks very odd if not outright silly on an otherwise very classy looking screen The tablet is quite light very thin and the 10 size is great for people who may be visually impaired like me I especially like the touch keyboard that automatically displays with the Google search bar Once I get past my learning curve Im sure Ill have more to say but all in all Im mostly happy with the purchase,5,63 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2024",True

B0CLF3VPMV,Great tablet for off roading,I had a 9 inch before but it was slow and laggy I decided to get a better one and found this I was not sure if the screen would be too large for me What I found is I personally love it It is absolutely awesome for both on road and off road navigation I loved being able to see way down my route and it was nice and fast so finding the next gas or food stop to add to my route was a breeze I also really like that you can split the screen three ways and when doing so all my apps worked well  I do not like in dash screen headunits so I purposely bought an old style with buttons and knobs So for me I was able to place the tablet low where it blocks most of the headunit so it does not block my view at all of the road I stream exclusively so really all I need is my steering wheel controls The 11 inch screen is big though and many if not most will probably not like it as much as I do For me it was a dream  I do have a data plan and bought the one for my service I have not had any issues The sim card went right in and was working giving me 5G service I do always download offline maps for my trips and on my last one that took me way out and without service the GPS of the tablet was great and never once did it not know where we were Made the trip a breeze  Personally I prefer using a tablet like this instead of a in dash screen for a few reasons First I can take it with me I can take if from vehicle to vehicle and then take it inside my tent hotel room house etc So I have everything right there in one place That brings me to my second reason of planning I can have it with me anywhere and plan my route and trips right there So if we stop to eat and I want to change some things and or check some things out I can easy and without having to sync anything or sitting in my vehicle Third I love that I can have it facing me I hate how a in dash screen points straight back and prefer to have it facing me for the best view This just works for me and I prefer it I do use the tablet for other things like cruising the web and it does that well too My last one I mainly only used for nav and kept the app count low to try and keep it as quick as possible That has not been an issue with this one and now watching a movie or show is much better on the much larger screen,5,32 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2024",True

B0CLF3VPMV,EXCELLENT Exactly what I was looking for and needed,I bought this tablet for my 4 year old and let me tell you why and how I came to this one My husband gave my toddler his old Android Galaxy tablet a year ago and it has since died It was a very old tablet but did what we needed it to do When it died I found an Amazon fire kids tablet which was not what I expected at all and though there being lots of things for kids there was very little parental control I actually had and we could not download the apps we wanted as its all through Amazon  I then ordered an android kids tablet and I had it set to return within a few hours of opening it because of similar issues We could download the apps we wanted but they were different youtube kids for example It did not allow us the option to log in to the account we already had and would not allow us the option to show only approved content It was preloaded with teacher approved content for the age range It had complete brain cells killing trash on it I would block one channel and 5 more would pop up The layout and format of the android kids tablet was also very different from the regular android tablets as well  It was at this point that I landed on this Galaxy Samsung tablet and I am SO happy with this purchase It is everything we need and were looking for The size is perfect the picture quality is great set up was a breeze it connected to wifi and Bluetooth headphones easily and quickly and the sound is great too It has a fast speed and it all works great It doesnt get hot and it doesnt ever freeze The price is super reasonable too especially for what you are getting  Bonus to this tablet and what makes it great for my son is that I can hide all the apps and basically everything on the tablet that I dont want my son messing with I can make it to where the ONLY things he can get into or have access to are the hand selected apps of my choosing I was able to log into kids youtube and log in with the same login we have on our TV and other devices so that saved time and allowed for my son to only see the content that I approved for him to watch I was able to download a bunch of the completely free and add free learning apps lucas and friends and he can have the fun of screen time all while it being all learning ABCs numbers learning how to spell how to write easy math puzzles etc  I wish I could go back in time and start with this tablet instead of wasting my time with the other two I tried out  If anything happens to this one I will definitely be buying again and recommending this tablet to my SIL for my nephew  I can also use this for myself as well  I bought the following kid proof case and it fits this tablet like a glove and will help protect it from my 4 year old dropping it  It has the front screen protector on it as well which will help shield the tablet from getting wet too if spilled on  httpswwwamazoncomgpawdB0CLYCJZTHpsc1refppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title,5,133 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2024",True

B0BHZT5S12,Beautiful Tablet for the Price,I just checked and found that this 10 tablet is my 11th Kindle Fire tablet since 2011 so you may say Im a fan My husband gets my handmedowns and since had I just bought a new 10 tablet back in February ocean he now gets that one and I get the new one lilac So were both happy We mostly use our tablets for reading and for that purpose they work great This 10inch tablet is a nice size not too heavy for reading or browsing the internet Overall it is a nice looking tablet at a good price and does what I need it to do That being said there are some limitations  1 Im not much of a gamer but some years back I got a few games for free on a Black Friday sale and enjoyed playing them I also downloaded another game that is free to play All three of these games worked great until I got to endgame I then had problems with the game slowing down and even freezing to the point where I was unable to play them to the finish I tried adding extra storage even going so far as buying a newer tablet but ultimately realized that it was a RAM issue Its disappointing to me that games would be sold in the Amazon Appstore when the RAM on the tablet wouldnt be able to support the demands of the game There is an upside I stopped playing them and now have more time to read yay  2 Even though my tablet is new it is becoming more and more apparent that Amazon is no longer supporting some of its own apps These apps are no longer working although the sites themselves can still be accessed using the Silk Browser Goodreads which Amazon owns so this is really a mystery especially because so many people do use their tablets for reading and both the Shop Amazon and the Photos app now take you to the Silk Browser where you need to sign in each time to access In the case of the Photos app it seems to have been replaced with the new Gallery app but as of this date Gallery is extremely limited in function To use a new photo wallpaper for example I had to click on the Photos app sign in find and download locally the picture I wanted to use and only then could the innate wallpaper chooser see the photo which was also then available in Gallery Whew Prior to this change the wallpaper could be easily changed in one step as Amazon Photos was one of the choices along with the builtin wallpapers and you could scroll and select a photo as desired  If youre not an endgamer or dont really need or rely on the builtin Amazon apps youll be fine as this is still a more than decent tablet for the price,5,174 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2024",True

B0BHZT5S12,Gorgeous video quality,Being a senior newbie in ownership of the first tablet ever I really like this tablet  Ive had it now a month and being disabled I have been using it faithfully every day for many many hours per day Since Ive never had a tablet before I cant really compare it to another  But there are a couple of issues I have been having and dont know if this is normal behavior for a tablet or not  First issue that is really bothered to me is that after watching a lot of videos from streaming most of the day that suddenly the videos start getting choppy This means that Ill be watching a video and it hits a snag and stalls briefly and then starts up and continues to do this nonstop  It gets so irritating that I have to stop watching videos completely and turn the tablet off  No this isnt a WiFi buffer issue  I have a similar issue with my flat screen TV because its not a Smart TV and its older  With the TV though Im lucky if I can watch more than a movie before the subtitles go off sync with the video and have to restart  Im suspecting that the video stalling issue might be other than the tablet but dont know for sure  But Ill have watched videos most of a day before this stalling starts to happen  Since I cant be certain if the issue is with the tablet and not the streaming service I give the benefit to the tablet  The second issue is with the video selection on the tablet  Ill have the screen with a bunch of squares of different videos to select from and when I select one on the screen it responds by opening up something completely different that is on a different part of the screen  Again I dont know if this is a tablet issue for sure but it is a little annoying when Im trying to decide on what I want to watch next and something else pops up that I didnt select  Also when Im watching a video the tablet doesnt respond always when I touch it to pause it  Again dont know if this is a tablet issue or not  BUT I love both the video and audio quality of the tablet  I got the tablet for the purpose of watching my streaming videos and its been a wonderful experience  One thing that really pleasantly surprised me was the audio  Absolutely fantastic  Its like having surround sound when watching videos  I got the case to go with the tablet as well and its really nice  It took me a bit to adjust to the case in maneuvering it in my bed when laying down but its satisfactory  After all these things arent really designed with the disabled in mind  But it is a nice quality case cover for the tablet  I have a few cats so the case cover protects it very nicely against their tendencies to lay atop the tablet  Its a good protection for falling off the bed when Ive fallen asleep  So for my first experience with a tablet this is great  Makes me wonder what took me so long to buy one,5,295 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2024",True

B0BHZT5S12,Employee kudos  the secret to 15W charging,Someone at Amazon deserves many kudos for getting this Fire HD 10 13th generation 2023 release tablet to me before I left for Guatemala in the early morning hours of Thursday February 8th A few days before my trip I went to download content on my Fire HD10 9th generation 2019 release tablet but it would not start I disassembled it and found the battery fully charged but the power distribution chip was toast Finding no way to get it repaired locally I ordered another one February 6th which before I added it to my cart and before I completed my purchase was promised overnight shipping The new tablet was to arrive Wednesday February 7th by 11am After completing my purchase I noticed this had been changed to just sometime on February 7th I looked at my orders around 330 pm February 7th and discovered arrival was now February 9th I called customer service gave them the what for was transferred to Amazon shipping gave them the what for also even offered to drive down to the distribution center and pick it up myself I was left with little hope of getting my new tablet before my trip Then at 9 pm a knock at my door someone had come through  The Fire HD 10 13th generation 2023 release has a vastly different xy dimension than the 9th generation 2019 release I had to order a new case but I like the new form factor better  The Fire HD 10 13th  2023 release collects a lot more dirt in the groove between its glass front and plastic backing than did either my HD 10 9th generation 2019 release or my HDX 7 before it Im constantly trying to get it out with my thumbnails  The power button is in the wrong place on the 13th generation 2023 release 9 times out of 10 when I go to turn up the volume I end up turning it off  Do what you love uninterruptedbut only if you can find the secret to recharging faster than 5 to 9 hours The Fire HD 10 13th generation says its native Amazon 9W charger depending on starting battery level takes 5 hours to fully recharge Thats way too long to wait if youre wanting to use your tablet Read on and Ill tell you how to access 15W USBC charging that only takes 2 hours  I read Fire tablets with USBC charging ports are capable of up to 15W charging I did not want to buy a 15W charger fire hazard from one of the many 6 UPPERCASE CHARACTER named Chinese companies offering them here on Amazon I have other charges from a prominent brand here on Amazon some claiming PD 30 offering up to 5V48A and rated up to 60W that were taking anywhere from 5 to 9 hours Why didnt these work Whats the secret to 15W Charging  Well I found it Fire tablets with USBC charging ports at least the 13th generation 2023 release HD 10 use the PD PPS protocol to negotiate 15W charging But why didnt my existing name brand chargers provide 15W Theres more detail on that below  You need a charger with PD 30 PPS or PD 31 thats guaranteed to have PPS to get 15W charging If a manufacturer claims PD 30 but fails to mention PPS in the product description use the Looking for specific info box to Search in reviews QA for PPS You need at least 3A in whatever PD PPS voltage output range contains 5V  Details The Fire HD 10 uses an order of precedence when negotiating a charging solution with a charger first attempting PD negotiation then ultimately dropping back to basic USB Type C charging when PD negotiation fails Basic USB Type C charging power drops off dramatically during charging leading to 5 to 9 hour charging times whereas PD PPS power stays fairly close to 15W the entire time 15W PD PPS charging should really only take 2 hours from 10 to full or youve been taken  Some 6 UPPERCASE CHARACTER named Chinese companies are offering 5V3A 15W USBA chargers using a USBA to USBC cable with integrated 56 ohm resistor to emulate a USBC to USBC cable Sorry these may be able to provide the requisite 15W but USB PD is just not available from a USBA charger port Some 6 UPPERCASE CHARACTER named Chinese companies offer 5V3A 15W USBC chargers using USBC to USBC cables that dont offer USB PD protocol I have a handful of older chargers of these types from a reputable charger manufacturer and one does provide more power initially 115W than the native 9W Amazon charger but basic USB Type C charging starts at lower power than true USB PD charging and drops off rapidly Ive seen the Fire HD 10 reported anywhere from 5 to 9 hours until fully charged for these basic USB Type C chargers  USB Power Delivery PD 10 was released July 2012 With the USB PD 10 you get six fixed power profiles for different device categories 5V2A 12V15A 12V3A 12V5A 20V3A and 20V5A  The USB Power Delivery 20 fast charging standard was released August 2014 With the USB PD 20 you got fixed voltages 5V3A 9V3A 12V3A 15V3A and 20V5A  The USB Power Delivery 30 fastcharging standard was released November 2015 USB PD 30 made functional improvements but did not present voltage differences compared to USB PD 20 you still got fixed voltages 5V3A 9V3A 12V3A 15V3A and 20V5A  The USB Power Delivery 30 PPS fastcharging standard was released February 2017 This version adds a programmable power supply PPS that can realize voltage and current regulation using USB PD protocol output In addition to USB PD 20 and USB PD 30 fixed voltages USB PD 30 PPS has specific PPS voltages which are 33V59V 3A 3311V 3A 3316V 3A

my FNIRSI FNB58 says supports USB PD 20 PDO4 The 4 PD output profiles are 5V  3A  9V  3A  15V  3A  20V  3A My FNIRSI FNB58 says the Fire HD 10 negotiates PD 10 14W but it seems unable to decode the

B0BHZT5S12,Its a pretty cool tablet,This tablet that I ordered from Amazon is a Amazon fire HD 10 its a good little tablet is slim and skinny and it really has a nice blue back on it but I am used to Android tablets yes sir and Android tablets are different than Amazon fire HD 10 yes sir I mean instead of having Google Play store it has an app store so its hard to find my games but even when I do find my games it wont download because theyre not compatible with the Amazon fire HD tablet unfortunately but Im still using the tablet anyway it will be great to read my Kindles if I ever get Kindles and auto books yes sir I like it where it actually reached the story to you yes sir I tried it out on a Kenda once one story and I like the idea I would actually reading to you because Im not the worlds best reader thats for sure the price was good too nothing just needs about its a good tablet I just wont be able to play anyway Android games on it but there are tons of games that are available from Amazon I guess thats what those games are which is cool yes sir so its a good tablet the price is good but Android tablets are different then Amazon tablets thats for sure it takes a lot to get used to a Amazon fire HD 10 but it seems like an Amazon fire tablet has good games on it but theyre different yep so if you are expecting the Google Play store Im sorry to say its an app store if I remember correctly yes sir but its a good great tablet it will do in the pitch,5,11 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024",True

B0BZWRSRWV,Great Video Quality and Battery Life,First 2 days review This product has great camera quality and because of the fish lens eliminates blind spots even when placed at an angle The Battery life is great considering I have it set to highly motion sensitivity and it only loses 12 at most 3 of battery per day If you dont buy the extra adhesive place holder for this product which I didnt you need a drill capable of drilling 4 holes through the surface youd like to place it on  I marked a sharpee line on the drill bit just how far the wall plug goes so I knew how deep to drill There is a tutorial for this on the app as well Charging takes about an hour or 2 it seems so whenever Im at home about once a month I can give it a charge maybe less frequently than that considering its strong battery life The ring app works smoothly and the lag is only about one second Video and Audio quality are definitely a plus A price of 50 and change per camera seems a fair deal in exchange for the additional layer of security Especially with an upcoming holiday season Ill update this review when I learn about the subscription services and what it entails,5,45 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2024",True

B0BZWRSRWV,Here is info hard to find,To start buy the wired unit that comes with a rechargeable battery if you have an existing doorbell Yes the 10 to 24 volt from your doorbell transformer will keep the battery charged Yes the Ring doorbell will activate your existing doorbell chime so do not buy a separate chime Dont panic when you first wire it to existing doorbell wires Part of the install process is for th Ring doorbell to look for an existing chime and initialize or whatever it does to know it is there Putting this in my review as I had a hard time finding this info on the vendor sites or any reviews Setup is easy The hardest part for my install was getting the mounting plate to be flat enough for the Ring doorbell to click into this mount I have a stucco wall which creates flex in the mounting plate when attached To get it to click I had to remove one of four screws and loosing others so that I could get my fingers on the back of the mounting plate to be able to get it flat to click to the doorbell The mounting plate is plastic and easily flexes which will not allow the security snap to click into a locked position Then to get the doorbell to not move I added a shim behind Installed the doorbell is a bit clunky looking but video is good and works well taking video in the dark Hope this helps others,4,57 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2024",True

B0BZWRSRWV,Good doorbell,This doorbell has a very long battery life so far  I have had it over a month and have not even had to charge it yet  I got it at a great price as well  I also think the video quality is pretty good  There are a few negatives though  I probably wouldnt have bought it if I had known I would have to pay 50year just to keep all videos to view later  And if you dont get it it tells you someone was at your door and you are left in suspense to who it was  I dont like that at all  It also doesnt come with a chime you have to buy one for 35  It also drives me a little crazy because it alerts every time me and my husband goes in and out the door but there really is no way around that unless you disarm it and then what is the use anyway  Overall I like it but think the subscription should be cheaper  I also hope the battery lasts  I would love to have gotten the wired one but live in an older brick home without a preexisting wired bell  I  dont know if it would be possible to drill through the brick to wire it  Overall it is worth the 59 I paid,4,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2024",True

B07J1FZQBC,Genealogy buffs must use their ThruLines and Common Ancestor Tools,No surprises  I know a lot of people have unusual and hardtodetermine ancestry or even progeny but let me reassure you that the accuracy seems flawless to me I had literally no surprises in my results which may seem a bit boring at first blush But its exciting to confirm all of the research that I did on Ancestry and Family search for the last 2 years  I have a regular and recurring Ancestry account that I paid lessthanfull price for thanks to coupons and this kit worked extremely well with it Everybody should know that they run sales for the kits all the time pick a holiday that entails family members and youll find a discount here So I got mine near Black youknowwhat day and it was probably the best sale youll see  My tree of over 1000 people is woefully incomplete in my cousin lines I had only worked on direct ancestors Well if you are like me now you can do two things you can 1 add in your cousins with DNA matches most of which will be alive and 2 confirm or fix your direct ancestors I was happy when I was able to do 2 especially for my fathers line It turned out that my fathers fathers father was quite the ladys man He sort of loved them and leaved them so to speak Well I have several cousins because of all this While not entirely unexpected it had been assumed that he died Nah he was just starting a new family elsewhere  It also helped me figure out who his father was So I guess the secret is out and I can confirm the rest of my admittedly boring tree  So I got many many DNA links and some of them shared quite a bit 1 to 3 of my DNA  And I pretty much can put a damper on the old wives tales about being descended from Indians Either they made that up or I got no DNA from them  I recommend 1 you work on your tree in Ancestry you will need a subscription 2 you watch a video about using the DNA matches and ThruLines 3 you learn about cM 4 you compare your tree to your 1st 2nd 3rd cousins trees 5 you eventually try the dot method to identify hiddenunknown lines in your tree 6 you make your tree public to help others  I sort of forgot about the traits Anyway they are interesting and I already found three traits which dont describe me well  I actually think Ancestry DNAs traits are terrible I hate them You know why They somehow refuse to explain them They go to all of this trouble to identify the genes for iris coloration and nose shape but they cant be bothered with photos of ACTUAL humans not drawings of a Grecian nose or a pigmented ring Even an attached ear lobe could help some people  I also dont like their male hair loss trait when it has been called male pattern hair loss for decades And get this their photo for male hair loss shows a BALD man who appears to have his head shaved and is relatively young instead of the commonlyseen man with bald spots at that age  Possibly the stupidest trait is CLEFT CHIN see photo Rather than showing us a cleft chin they draw white dots where one would be  on a stock photo of someone without one Come on man Really I also looked up cleft chin on the Interwebs and there is a funny study of US Senator photos that concludes it is hard to draw a clear boundary between cleft and smooth chins Traits may be fun for kids in 5th grade science but this is just embarrassing  So while I cant really complain if I have 3 traits or so that dont describe me their questionnaires are confusing and the results need a lot of fixing  The traits were not something that sold me on this test they seem both to me and the DNA Traits website team to be an afterthought DNA testing is to figure out how you relate to others You sort of already know who you are So 5 stars with a caveat ignore the man behind the curtain that tells you that you dont like dancing  but you like to run marathons  You have been warned DNA Traits are very underwhelming scientifically questionable confusing in their descriptions and no more accurate than a palm reading  Also my results came fast And I submitted them during the December rush period I liked that They completely overdelivered on speed here,5,231 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2024",True

B0016HF5GK,Small Yet Mighty,I wanted to wait to write a review until I had tested the Little Green on multiple types of stains on various fabricscarpets and it has not disappointed So far Ive had 100 success cleaning up cat vomit dog bile and mud These stains were cleaned off a wool throw rug nylonpolyester blend carpet and polyester upholstery respectively I used the provided Bissel Spot  Stain Febreeze solution and didnt find it to have an overwhelming scent  Pros  It works which is the biggest thing for me Plus a couple of these stains like the cat vomit one on the living room wool rug had been there for months and nothing I tried would get it out  The machine is relatively light to carry around and is compact to stow away when finished  I liked that the electrical cord was very long which made it easy to use in rooms with only a few outlets  Any animal lover will know that no matter how much vacuuming you do theres always going to be some stray hairs left behind Im pleasantly surprised that the Little Green has yet to get clogged while Ive been cleaning I always wash the pieces after each use but it seems like my Labs hair could clog anything But not Little Green  Cons  I wish I could remove the hose completely to clean it but the parts that can be removed to clean are easy to do so  When you load up the watersolution mixture into its tub and turn it upside down to install it into the machine it does leak a little bit Once its in the machine it doesnt continue leaking but it did catch me off guard the first time I used it thinking I did something wrong  I wish the instructions told me how best to use each of the attachments It tells you how to install them but I had to search online for more guidance on appropriate usage  Overall the cons are very small things compared to the pros Especially if you have animals or children I would highly recommend this little guy Ive been telling family and friends about it ever since I got mine,5,749 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2024",True

B0016HF5GK,I wanted to like this so bad,Like many of you I was influenced to purchase this item from a social media app I hopped on Amazon because I wanted to buy it from a reputable source Upon first and last use it leaked Now I cant lie It did work well It cleaned up eight months worth of stains and dog fur off of my couch But still it leaked all over my floor wasting the cleaning product it came with I barely had to dump out any water when I was done because it ended up all over my floor The other annoying part was that it came with an unnecessary step of having to screw in the part that holds the hose to the main part of the machine Why wouldnt it come already screwed together It was such a small piece not like it wouldnt have fit in the box so it was an unnecessary assembly to put on the customer I didnt have a screwdriver so of course I had to wait to use it Its also pretty loud when you use it but thats not unexpected for a vacuum If it wasnt for the leaking and the unnecessary assembly I would have given 5 stars Honestly I would have gotten over the screwing part if it wasnt leaking all over my floor during use  Edit changing my original 3 star review to a five 5 review OK so I guess I was lowkey being an idiot and filling past the waterline although I swear I wasnt I tried again and took it slow with filling it up making sure count the foam as water if you know what I mean Even though I was still annoyed at having to screw it in I obviously got over it once I really got to put the machine to work Im curious to know how the other machines run compared to this one but I am happy with purchase now that Ive got a few uses in I got the corded one and while part of me wishes as I got the cordless one for use in my car Im glad that in the long run I wont have to worry about a battery life Ive had my light cream couch for over a year and a half and finally was able to go in and give it a decent clean The dirty water dump was so satisfying With a small black dog its nice to know Ill always be able to bring this couch back to life,5,232 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2024",True
B0016HF5GK,The replacement unit works great now 5 stars now,25Jul24 Update  I used it on my stairs First I used my big Shop Vac to get at all possible loose dirt Yes I balanced my large shop vac on the stairs as I vacuum each carpeted step My shop vac suction is far greater than any standard vacuum so I figured okay it should not be that dirty with using the Little Green I WAS WRONG The little green worked great as the water was like brown sewage water I was like wow thats a lot of dirt that was in the carpet fiber that my shop vac didnt get Im impressed  Now the only caution I would mention is that when on it is loud it was in the range of 8788 decibels to which 80 is considered loud noise Because in use you are as close to it I would suggest ear plugs Keep in mind that typical upright vacuum cleaners are also in that range as well but you are closer to the little green as you are using the hand held brush head  There is also an attachment called hydro rinse that works well to rinse clean the machine hose etc after using the machine That works great and helps clean the machine for your next use I like that they have this Overall Im happy with this replacement unit and is working great  24Jul24 Update  I received the replacement unit but it did also remind me that the hatprevious unit that I received not only had the crimped hose but that it also had water droplets in the tank So was that a repackaged one that I originally received Cause the replacement one is a different box and its tanks are dry  Will update you on how it works on my carpeted stairs  Original Review  I needed it to work on cat pee stains in the carpet and bed mattress Butit came with a crimped hose that was bent on how they had it  in the box Didnt really think anything about it but in use it resulted in poor performance So what happens with the bent hose is that at that bent it starts to suction close on itself so there is little to no suction at the head That was so terrible So sending it back for replacement Bissell folks please relook on how  everything is packed in the box cause it is causing this bentcrimped hose Or make the box bigger so this doesnt happen in the way its packed Otherwise will update how it works when zI get the replacement I havealso the traditional Bissell carpet cleaner which I love so I want this portable to supplement or use instead of the big carpet cleaner unit when I only want to spot clean for cat pee etc,5,119 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2024",True

B0016HF5GK,Would Give 10 Stars if I Could  This MACHINE is AWESOME,First let me say I dont normally take time to write reviews but I just had to share my story because Im still giddy about how well this machine worked I recently purchased a beautiful cream designer chair at a furniture consignment shop and the lighting must have been bad in the store because I didnt notice at all that it was quite dirty I was just so excited that it was exactly what I had been looking for  color size style and price When I got it home it was perfect in every way EXCEPT the offwhite that was so perfect in the fluorescent lighting was a dingy EWWW  in the natural light of our living room I took the armrest covers off and YUCK I noticed how dirty the arms were and then noticed that I hadnt looked that closely on the store  there were spots all over the chair The store doesnt take returns AND I loved everything about the chair except the grime and spots how did I not notice those in the store so I googled best upholstery cleaner and the BISSELL Little Green Machine showed up as toprated in multiple blogs so I searched for it on Amazon It had awesome reviews confirming what the blogs has said so I ordered it It came superfast and was easy to set up I got to work Well my sweet husband got to work My plan was to have him handle the task as hes usually in charge of the grimy stuff Love that man  Well I had no idea cleaning upholstery could be so fun This little machine sucked the grime right out It was really satisfying to see it get sucked out right before my eyes Before  my husband knew it he was free to watch his baseball game because I had taken over When I was finished the cream chair looked like new And I didnt stop there I had a 14year old blue chair in my home office that had weathered two babies lots of journaling and phone conversations with my feet tucked up underneath me latte spills and justa full life Our whole family loves mommys blue chair as its where good conversations and snuggles have happened my kids entire lives When we recently remodeled our home I was looking for a new chair for myself My whole family protested because they loved it so much It bummed me out because  well LOOK at the before photos of the blue chair I posted Our whole house was clean and fresh from the muchneeded after 17 years in the house remodel Having to look at that chair as much as I loved the memories of it grossed me out So when I finished the cream chair I thought Im going to see what the BISSELL Little Green Machine could do for the blue chair I figured worst case scenario it would make it worse and then Id HAVE to get my new chair  I honestly didnt think it would make a difference I had actually had a professional rug  upholstery cleaner look at it and say he couldnt do anything to make it look better just two months ago during the remodel So despite seeing the INCREDIBLE results on the cream chair my expectations were low Additionally this was an inexpensive chair with a sueded microfiber fabric  not nearly as well made as the cream chair so I wasnt sure if the not supersturdy fabric would withstand the cleaning fluid or brush I was blown away As you can see by the Before and After photos  the BISSELL mighty little machine did an amazing job The blue chair is saved and we are ALL excited Yes even me  I just wish I would have taken videos of cleaning the blue chair  the water was SO dirty GROSS Again though it was SO satisfying throughout the process to see the dirt come out and have brand new chairs This machine is WELL worth the very reasonable price and I also absolutely love being able to restore two chairs rather than buy new ones Less landfill and consumerism to help the planet And the pocketbook A little technique scoop if youre still reading  on the cream chair we sprayed the cleaning water from the machine on the area then sprayed Resolve and let it sit for a minute or two before we sucked up the dirt The Resolve did make the dirty water in the tank pretty foamy and Im not sure if it could damage the machine or the chair but when we tried it we were kind of thinking we didnt have anything to lose as the fabric was so grungy when we got it home to natural light we would not have kept the chair if the BISSELL didnt work The machine seems totally fine and of course the chair is now clean and beautiful I could not possibly love this little machine more and now I can feel much more confident with all of our new carpet and furniture because if we get a spill or a stain this lightly little green machine will take care of it I highly recommend the BISSELL Little Green Machine,5,"4,542 people found this helpful","Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2022",True
B0016HF5GK,My New Favorite Household Tool,My daughter uses one of these and strongly recommended I buy one for spot cleaning my rugs but especially for cleaning the rugs on my stairs to the second floor  I had been previously juggling a fullsized carpet cleaner when doing the rugs on my twenty carpeted steps and at 72 years old it was getting a bit precarious to say the least  This little gem did the job with none of the concern of balancing a full size carpet cleaner on the staircase  Does it deep clean as well as a fullsized carpet cleaner  No probably not but it more than makes up for that with how much easier and safer it was to use  Because of the ease of use and how well it did actually work I am definitely more apt to use this carpet cleaner more often so the steps should stay just as clean  Recommendations  Definitely take the time to read the manual as it shows how to attach the items necessary to properly store the hose and tools included  It also gives details on how to properly flush the hair and dirt out of the product after EVERY use so debris does not permanently harden in hard to reach places in the tools  Also you will probably need a 3prong extension cord if you are going to be using this on a full size staircase as the cord only allowed me to reach about halfway down and one quarter of the way up my staircase  Fortunately I had my husband buy one for another use just the day before this arrived on my doorstep from Amazon  So if you dont already own one measure how long an extension cord you will need to buy and order that at the same time as you order your Bissell Little Green Carpet Cleaner if you are going to use it to clean the carpets on your staircase  PS  My mini labradoodle Teddy Bear thinks every picture I take is supposed to have her in it  Clearly she thinks the world revoves around her Well it kind of does revove around her now  LOL,5,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2024",True

B09B8V1LZ3,Great except for a little difficulty with the iPhone,I got my Dot yesterday and found it easy to set up except when it came to 2 Applerelated issues First the Alexa app is buggy about connecting to Apple Music It isnt just a problem with the latest version because Reddit is full of threads from 2 and 4 years ago about getting error messages after logging into an Apple account from this app Fortunately one of those threads pointed me to a link on the Amazon website where I was able to link my Apple Music account the way it should be able to be linked through the Alexa app After that I was able to connect Apple Music to the Alexa app and voice commands to the Dot now work fine for listening to my playlists  Second I had an issue using the Dot as a Bluetooth speaker to play Apple Music via AirPlay It connects and plays the music fine but the Dot makes extremely earsplitting smokealarm loud announcements whenever it connects to my phone via Bluetooth Since I was trying to use my phone in the middle of the night for ambient music to help sleep and since this was more than loud enough to disturb my upstairs neighbors AirPlay was a nogo As for the previous issue a quick search yielded years of Reddit threads about this issue but no solutions other than to not connect any devices to the Dot via Bluetooth  So it was a rough first day with the Alexa app failing to connect me to the music source I subscribe to  Im guessing it works just fine for Amazon Music  and with the Dot itself making such loud announcements if I try to use AirPlay that there is just no reasonable way for me to live with the Dot as a Bluetooth speaker But if I block the Dot from connecting with my phone it works great as intended  with Alexa voice commands The sound quality is as good as youd expect from such a tiny speaker and exactly what I wanted for bedtime music in an apartment building  very clear sound with little bass so that I can listen to podcasts or ambient music at 2 AM and not bother neighbors,4,61 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2024",True

B09B8V1LZ3,Another great smart home purchase to say the least,My previous Echo Dot purchased back in 2018 was a thirdgeneration It was a white shuffleboard stone covered in cloth and it is amazing Ill never say its not in fact its so amazing that I passed it on to my mom and she enjoys it a great deal  So my main motivation for purchasing this the fifth generation issued in 2022  aside from familiarity with the brand  was I needed a Matter hub so my thenincoming Nanoleaf smart lightbulbs could work with my voice But of course it is so much more  First thing I see is that the Echo Dot is no longer a white shuffleboard stone but is a smaller navy blue sphere Aside from being my favorite color and thus very pleasing to look at I find it that it is not practical any longer to mount on my wall because of its increased focus on the forward firing speaker if I had mounted it it would not be effective in spreading out to my entire room  the top of the speaker is reserved for the buttons which were present on the thirdgeneration volume up volume down actionwake and mute microphone which leave no room for a speaker in that area So it sits pretty on my side table facing the rest of my room and does fine  First thing I hear is the sound quality is so much better than the thirdgeneration Dot The thirdgeneration was okay in that regard but it tended to sound a little overexposed when the volume was up high Now I dont find myself connecting via Bluetooth to my sound bar nearly as much because the speaker quality is just that good The quiet parts of music are quiet and calming the way they should be but the bass thumps quite effectively surprisingly for such a small and lightweight speaker  So after Id established the smart speaker in my room for about a month I felt the time was right to go ahead and get my Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs to upgrade the ones that I had no longer been able to use for a year since they had stopped working with any voices assistants to facilitate compatibility with the then upcoming network standard Matter I am very happy to say that Matter compatibility is there and it is wonderful  I cant speak for the internal workings because Im not an engineer I will say  though I may be wrong about this  that I believe it would be more rocky if I did not have a Thread Border Router already in the form of my Nanoleaf shapes controller I have the shapes arrangement atop my desk called Dragon and it has worked wonderfully for me since around last September and only  at this point anyway  required regular firmware updates to be compatible with ongoing technology  Now Ill tell you the procedure for adding the Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs to Alexa via Matter  I would assume by extension any Matter device providing you have a thread border router like I mentioned before After adding the bulbs to the iOS Nanoleaf app as normal  also updating the firmware for each bulb via said app I have a feeling that was very important  add them also to Alexa via the Add Device flow one at a time There was a menu item that showed itself at the top telling me that it had detected each new bulb on my network and I only had to select that item to add it scan the QR code on the sticker that came with the bulbs I applied the sticker to a sheet of paper and labeled it according to the positions of the bulbs and wait just a bit for it to be connected and it just works  Another new feature which the thirdgeneration did not have is a temperature sensor After a short period of calibration after plugging the device in Alexa will be able to tell you the temperature of the room that it is situated in I ask her for this often when Im trying to determine how best to cool my room during these hot summer months When my doors closed during the day my room can get up to mid 80s which is horrible but with the door open to allow a draft and breeze the temperatures equalized with the rest of the house and I get mid to upper 70s which is much better  There is an ultrasound presence sensor which sounds not unlike sonar which I have not had a use for yet but I imagine routines can be enabled or suppressed with its use  One borderline negative thing I will say about it which Im okay with because again I have Bluetooth connections  they eliminated the 35 mm jack to save internal space inside the device so you will no longer be able to directly connect external speakers as I did at one point before I had to change that arrangement  Once again Amazon comes through with flying colors with their products helping make our homes smarter and more amazing and just better to live in Get this speaker if you are looking to build a smart home and for best results get more than one so you can use the awesome dropin intercom system and truly awaken the potential of the smart home,5,178 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2023",True

B09B8V1LZ3,Terribly flawed setup process,I have no idea how amazon made such a basic device so ridiculously difficult to set up I ordered one of these a few days ago spent a few hours trying to set it up consulted the internet and nothing really worked It continually got stuck at the searching for wifi step and being unsuccessful in finding any networks I tried manually connecting it using a mobile hotspot restarting my router etc etc etc It could not find ANY signal at all I called customer support did a hard reset tried some things and still nothing The lady recommended I return the device and order a new one so I got a refund returned the first unit and ordered a new one  I was conflicted whether I should order this same model again or try a completely different smart speaker Ultimately I decided to give it one more shot and I received the new unit today Plugged it in had guarded hopes Again same issue that it couldnt find a network to connect to So I shut off Bluetooth and tried manual connection again This time a list of networks came up  but not my network So I added my network and it would glitch and start over I tried half a dozen times to add my network and it still wouldnt show up or connect I tried another hard reset for the device and repeated adding my network again to no avail Back to consulting the internet I hard reset the device and followed a guide I found on Reddit Still it didnt work with my wifi network so I had the idea to download the alexa app on my tablet and use my phone hotspot instead of my wifi I read something that if you leave the app page for ANY reason during setup even just the device falling asleep for a second or two the app will glitch and connection with fail So I hard reset the device again added device selected the echo dot disconnected my tablets bluetooth selected manual connection in the app then connected to the Amazon wifi network let it search for wifi came up with a list that didnt include mine and so I manually added my hotspot networks name and password It did its little loading thing and sent me back to the searching for wifi page The list of networks came up again and alas it happened My hotspot appeared on the network page I clicked it feeling as though Alexa were playing tricks on me but after all my failed attempts it finally connected  to my hotspot but at least there was a shred of hope somewhere in the universe that this tiny frustrating device had some potential if only I could just add my personal wifi network instead  So all I had to do was spend another hour repeatedly fiddling with the app trying to add a new network so I could move it off of my hotspot to my wifi I followed the same steps that worked for the hotspot connection minus the hard reset and after the third or fourth attempt it finally connected And then I had to unplug it to move it to its permanent location 10 feet away from my router I did all this at the same outlet my router is plugged into because it was struggling so much I considered just leaving if there for eternity because I didnt want to risk it reseting and having to deal with all the connection issues again You have no idea the relief I felt when I plugged it into its permanent outlet and it automatically reconnected If I had to mess with the setup process from scratch again I probably wouldve just returned it again  I dont understand how this is a 5th generation device with such a flawed and frankly crappy set up process I had to go digging through my router settings app settings restartedreset the device multiple times rebooted my router consulted customer support poked around multiple online forums and spent hours trying to get this cursed little orb functioning That said it is now working Well see how it holds up over the next few weeks If it had so much trouble finding my wifi in the first place Im curious to see how itll hold up and if it will stay connected or continue posing issues All I know is when I move out and have to set it up again in a few years lord help me,4,23 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2024",True

B09B2SBHQK,Could be great but has some really annoying issues,We had a first generation Echo Show in our kitchen which died recently so I ordered this as a replacement not realizing how small it is  Its about the size of a standard alarm clock which is too small for our kitchen  Rather than returning it though I decided to keep it for the bedside table which appears to be what it was made for  I then ordered an Echo Show 8 for the kitchen which is a much better size for there  Anyway having this on the nightstand is nice because not only does it function as a clock but I can ask it about the weather the news etc in the morning  The bluetooth speaker has very good sound for its size  Overall its a great purchase  Except  Its got a couple of really annoying flaws that severely limit its usefulness  Ugh  Amazon I really hope youre listening here  At least the first of these should be fixable with a simple software update  The second Im not as sure if its a software problem or a hardware issue but I hope that it will at least be updated by the next model  While Im probably not going to return this one I cant see myself buying another one of these or recommending it to other people until these issues get fixed  So first problem Using it as a bluetooth speaker  I like to play music from Apple Music on my iPad and I was hoping to use this for that  Yes you can link your Apple Music account directly into the Echo Show but thats got a couple of flaws  first you cant browse you have to tell Alexa what to play and second if youve got your own music that youve uploaded to Apple Music because its not in the main Apple Music library or another app entirely there is as far as I can tell no way to access it  So using the Echo Show as a bluetooth speaker it is  Except  Once you pair your iPad with Alexa it will very loudly announce that its connected  Now connected to Matts iPad it says very loudly  If I had it connected previously and I start using my iPad after leaving it sit for a while say I was listening the night before and I pick up my iPad in the morning to glance at the news even if Im not playing audio it will make the same announcement again which totally unexpected like that gives me a good jump scare  Disconnect the iPad and it makes a loud notification sound for a while it was saying Disconnected from Matts iPad but I seem to have managed to at least turn that off Im not even sure how  It does the same if I connect and disconnect my phone  I dont want this  Its super annoying  Ive tried every way that I can find to turn these bluetooth announcements off and I cant do it  Ive searched the internet and found lots of other people complaining of the same issue but Amazon hasnt fixed it  Some of those have suggested turning off notifications as the solution but Ive tried that even going as far as power cycling my Echo Show to make it reboot and I still get the bluetooth announcements  They just wont go away  So first thing this needs before Ill give it a good rating Amazon please do away with these bluetooth announcements or at least make it possible for me to disable them  Honestly Id prefer not to have to completely disable notifications to do it theres no fine grain control over notifications its either all on or all off which is a problem itself but if thats how it has to be whatever  Just get rid of these unnecessary and annoying bluetooth announcements  Then theres what is actually a much bigger problem but may require a hardware update to fix The autodimming  So in theory I like and want the autodimming feature  I dont want this to be at full brightness all night while the room is dark  In the dark it goes very dim but that makes it readable in the dark without being annoying or a distraction from sleep  Thats good  Based on how this performs though I have to assume that the light sensor that controls the autodimming is on the front and very directionally focused  It doesnt pick up on ambient light at all  So if I turn on the bedside lamp which happens to be located behind the Echo Show 5 on my table  It doesnt pick up on it it still thinks the room is dark and it keeps the display so dim that its totally unreadable in the lamp light  I use my bedside lamp a lot when Im in the bedroom so that is a HUGE problem  Even if I have both the overhead light and the bedside lamp on and the screen is bright the moment I turn the overhead light off but leave the bedside lamp on it goes so dark as to be unreadable  But even when Im using the overhead light  If I even happen to stand or sit so that Im positioned between the overhead light and the Echo Show unit it dims the display  Not nearly as dim as it goes in the dark room or with the bedside lamp but still dim enough to make it significantly harder to read  So basically I can only read the screen easily with the room brightly lit or totally dark with light directly pointed at the unit or no light at all  Anywhere in between and it becomes unreadable  Of course I could fix this problem by turning autodimming off entirely but then it would be brightly lit all through the night  Which I dont want either  Right now the only setting for this is either on or off no inbetween no adjusting the sensitivity nothing  So Amazon I dont know if this means that you need more light sensors on the unit than you currently have maybe one facing the back of the unit as well or if its just a software tweak to make it more or less  I dont even know sensitive but SOMETHING needs to be done about this  A screen that I cant read isnt useful to me  Oh and finally this is more minor but what is up with the white power cord on my blackcharcoal device  I didnt buy a white Echo Show because I didnt want a white Echo Show  The power cord should match the device  Way to cheapout Amazon  Fix these problems and Ill feel much better about the Echo Show 5 and happily recommend it to others as a bedside device  With these issues though Im sorry but I cant recommend it,2,491 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2023",True

B0BL8WSCH3,Convenient on the go and durable Limited offline functionality,Average 3 stars but most likely still worth it for your needs My son has always enjoyed a little Super Simple Songs or dancing fruit on the go Previously I had my 13 iPad Pro in a Bam Bino space suit case and was using it for this purpose The size was not practical and neither was changing cases There was also the risk of entrusting a toddler with a 1000 electronic So I gave in It was time for a dedicated toddler tablet Something cheap and useful I thought I was getting a pretty good deal when I purchased this Fire tablet for 108 back in October Its now November and the tablet is 50 for 54 and Im kind of mad about it because this tablet was never worth 100 but it is definitely worth 50 Im very jealous of all of you potential purchasers reading this review right now Its not a great tablet but it is a good tablet which makes it a great tablet for your kid so if I were you Id buy it while its on sale  Pros  1 The case Its similar to the Space Suit case I was using on my iPad and more than enough to withstand my toddler chucking it on the hard ground from any height He has done this several times from his stroller from the shopping cart Im not kidding youit bounces Tablet stays safe Case is also easy to take off and put back on for easy cleaning The kickstand is also useful and versatile and also functions as a handle You can turn the tablet upside down and hang it from some things with the kickstand See con 3  2 Sizeweight Small and lightweight enough to go in the diaper bag or for my toddler to carry himself  3 Previously Fire tablets did not have a function to disable the touch screen such as Guided Access on an Apple device but now they do Its not as convenient to use but it works so that my kid cannot accidentally interrupt his video while fondling the screen  4 Purchase came with a 1 year free subscription of Amazon Kids which makes Con 2 a little less bad  Cons  1 The operating system Sorry Im not an Apple snob but Android tablets stink This was hard to set up Im not new to Fire tablets and pretty tech savvy so I knew what I was getting into but it was worse than I remembered This system is clunky slow and limited apps mainly but I just prayed it would be able to do the basics for my toddler And setting things up for a kids account was not intuitive at all Also be aware that youll be downloading an unofficial third party YouTube app because Amazons App Store does not have an official YouTube app I have heard there is a workaround if you download then go through Google Play but I dont care enough to carry out the extra steps  2 Limitations to offline playback I cant hotspot with my cell phone so being able to play videos offline is imperative I also have only the most basic tiers of streaming services that do not grant me access to the download feature and I dont have YT premium so I have to cheat if I want to download videos On my iPad I can achieve this with a video downloader I havent had any luck with this on the Fire tablet Luckily the free year of Amazon Kids includes a large library of kid videos that you can download and you can also download any digital video media you already have purchased through your Amazon account If your kid only likes very specific content this might not be a good solution for you Amazon had only one season of Bumble Nums and a few SSS videos so for now my kid just watches the same stuff on repeat Hopefully as he gets older and starts to enjoy a wider variety of videos and films this wont be such a drawback  3 The case I know I previously said that the case is a pro It is mostly a pro But it does not have a builtin screen protector like the Bam Bino space suit case does I didnt think Id need one but bought one separately just to be safe For 108 I think it should have been included The case is also pretty thick and the kickstand material is a slick hard plastic that doesnt always play well with tablet mounts Sometimes if were in the car and I hit a bump the tablet will fly out of the mount,3,38 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2024",True
B0BL8WSCH3,Overall good for price but some thoughts,We got this on a deal so definitely was worth the price that way including a case We do not let him play games and only allow certain streaming apps I personally liked it better with the kids subscription turned off so I know he watches just the usual movies and shows weve allowed him to There was just too much random stuff for his age in my opinion PBS is the only thing I let him surf to watch anything he wants That being said you cannot download Amazon Prime on a kids profile This is only a problem when we travel on airplanes because its our only streaming app we can download movies on so for him to watch the downloaded movies he has to be switched to the adult profile where I was able to save them Otherwise we have it connected to the home internet or a phone Hotspot in the car so the airplane rides are really the only area it gets inconvenient  Otherwise the case is cheap lightweight but durable I like the protection of 2yr free replacement I love the kids profile aside from the issue above so I can turn off the store and web access Although you cannot customize the home screen at all so the icons are there even though there is no access I wish I could remove them or at least combine them into a folder out of sight out of mind but you cant move them anywhere on the kids profile you can on the adult one so dumb design there But all in all worth it especially with the parent dashboard to control access even without the kids subscription Some people mentioned memory issues but with just a few streaming services downloaded on his profile and 56 movies  23 seasons of favorite shows downloaded on the adult profile it still has half the memory available So not an issues weve had and there isnt an SD card in use It is a little slow when trying to click too fast but not an issue for a younger kid whose only watching shows and not playing games,4,19 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024",True

B09T4YZGQR,Listen hold your breathcan you hear the thundering silence of me not having to vacuum,Where to start With the bad let us get that right out of the way The mapping is abysmal truly we have run Bruce if you can name a Shark branded robot vacuum what other name than Bruce would you choose 25 times he is nowhere near mapping our house compared to my brothers robot from a competitor who rhymes with BOOMBA which did it in three runs This Shark does not even play the same sportthis prevents me from doing room specific vacuuming And that is it Unless you have a multi story house where this feature is a must have set Bruce and he will clean you house Wonderfully Next the not so great Bruce is so mentally challenged For a smart device he is pretty dumb but you want to know something Bruce is determined He will get the job done He may have to fumble and bumble his way about but he will get it done and if you watch he does get a little smarter each time just a little but it is noticeable Bruce used to do the house in large long swaths now he breaks it into one half of the house then the other and just the today a new feature he went around the perimeter of the house cleaning the base boards Small steps As for his vacuum top notch perhaps too good  Bit of advice if you get your own Bruce run the beast on low suction for at least the first 4 or 5 runsanother con Bruce does not know when he has eaten too much and like a greedy guppy he dieslocks up and cries for help remember I told you Bruce is not bright but he is a work horse When this happens you cannot tell Bruce to restart he has to start over and hopefully one of Bruces engineers will fix this since Bruce will never know how much he has consumed he has not the ability Perhaps a command to send him to his base to empty himself or a shorter duration than the 30 or so minutes it defaults to Oh and the base the self emptyI am sure robot vacuums before the base were fine if tedious since you had to clean them every timebut the base oh the base is pure genius Bruces base is perfect we take up with a button and open it with a button and never have to touch the refuse No bag to buy just push a button the bottom opens  and all that stuff drops out If you have not noticed but this family loves Bruce we are now looking at getting Bruce a skin to spruce Bruce up a bitWe have had Bruce for a week now barely but already Bruce has made an impact I absolute honesty I cannot recommend this product enough it works it has quirks but it works and very well Bit of advice Turn on all your lights until your Bruce gets a good map of the area he is a camera based robot and needs to see the ceiling mostly for landmarks Run it on low the first few tries while Bruce bounces around the first few runs then move to medium and so on Remember Bruce has no sesnor in his bin he uses a set algorithm that tells him to go back to his base and dump his load It is terrible But his vacuum is great so he gets too full too fast I can manage it a little for the quality of his cleanup Because our house is neither toddler nor robot ready we did not have all our rooms ready and so we began mapping with the bedrooms and bathrooms doors closed This turned out to be a blessing in disguise the mapping is not great but it does move forward slowly Bruce stared being more efficient in our great rooms right about the time we added the bedrooms and bathrooms  Our house 3 bedroom 2 bath 2 great rooms and a heart kitchen Bruce can do it on one charge now I think because we basically added one room a day after his initial runs I think you can tell Bruce has been a wonderful addition to our home truly a robot vacuum was a luxury I didnt think worked It works and now I know what gift I will give every new home owner I know There a lot of options out there some a lot cheaper and if those meet your needs get them some a lot more expensive and aside from one specific feature Bruce does not have multi floor mapping  I cannot imagine they  are better  UPDATED 21920 Mapping works  now had to delete the map once  run it three times and bang house mapped Room specific vacuuming unlocked Suggestions to others having issues Delete the map and  and I think this part is important run the vac with every light you can on The robot see and makes its map on your ceiling the more light the better it sees To reiterate my little robot Bruce has literally changed my housecannot recommend enough  Updated 2521 A year later and no regrets One of if not the best purchases I have made for my home I will state again Bruce is an addition to the house and family he is almost a peta very dumb but very hard working pethe is like a toddlerhe seems to always want to be where you are He cleans your floors and carpetsIf you are on the fence about buying a robot vacuumlet me put  you at easebuy one this is no longer a luxury to my home they are a requirement utterly worth every penny As for a SharkI love mine Works great does what it is supposed to do The only house I wouldnt think this is perfect for is multi floor homes Short of that a must have  42823 Still the best purchase we have made for our

B09T4YZGQR,Works perfectly,Right out of the box set up was simple and after the robot charged it did a tour of the house The map was accurate and pretty detailed The app is easy to use and guides the user through setting up zones and schedules for cleaning  The robot itself isnt overly loud but the vacuum when emptying the bot is However the cup empties completely If the bots dirt cup fills while cleaning it returns to the base empties and picked up exactly where it left off Same if it runs low on charge It does take 34 hours to recharge but it returns to where it left off and finishes  I also did a matrix clean in our bedroom to get all the dust and dirt from under the bed and it did just that room flawlessly  No issues with our multiple area rugs or going from bare floors over thresholds into carpeted rooms  It has done three whole house cleanings and one matrix clean with no issues and plenty of suction to pick up small debris dust and dog hair  We have a long hair shepherdchow mix Hair is everywhere all the time  I have not yet cleaned the wheels or beater bar but plan to once a week I purchased replacement filters and brushes upfront to prevent downtime I cant yet speak to the durability because weve only had it a few days but it doesnt smack into things to find them the sensors seem to be working as advertised  We own multiple Shark products and Ninja All have performed as expected This robot vacuum is no different  Great value for the money,5,7 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024",True
B09T4YZGQR,First impression is this thing is very clunky,Update to the update So now this thing is working better Youve got to let this thing charge like 100 Let it map the house Then it works pretty good It got stuck a couple times on some obstacles but Im not going to knock that Once you vacuum proof AKA childproof your floor Itll work fine Every time its done vacuuming it dumps itself which is The first time Ive ever had a dumping vacuum It is definitely nice not to bend over and pull that dust bin out all the time with dogs All in all Im pretty happy with it Im knocking off a star because this thing is clunky Even brand new it sounds like its breaking Its got like a grinding crunching noise when the bar spins underneath the machine You also cant zoom into maps and see little tracks where the unit has run Other vacuums has little trails on where the unit went This just tells you it did that room in general It would be nice to see the exact route this thing took so I can see if I have to put a nogo zone somewhere Make sure you get it on sale and its worth the money End of story unless it breaks and Ill report back  Update Let it charge over 50 before you use it  When I set it up the app kind of let me run it right away and instead of mapping the house it just started cleaning  I put it back on the charger and let it go to 100  It seems to charge very very slow compared to my last one Once it was 100 charged it did map the house in about 15 mins and then it dumped itself and I set it off to clean  Seems to work pretty good over all  Lots of dog hair and dirt in the hopper  I will report back after a few weeks  So far I am happier than I was when I first got it so we will see   I think its important to log your first impression so here we go It was well packaged I was pleased to see that It takes up a good bit of space in your house so find a nice piece of wall It had 30 charge when I set it up and for some reason it wanted to get started mapping my house so I let it Im coming off of a wyze vacuum cleaner I had bought it twice from Amazon and I like it but some reason after a year the suction just seems to die down and no matter how much air I blow through it it doesnt seem to clean it out Thus this replacement My first thoughts is its like watching Grandpa walk around when hes lost at home The thing bumps into everything with no hope of actually having a plan It still mapping my house so Im going to give it the benefit of the doubt Right now Im not so impressed with the suction I dont know if it slow suction down while it maps the house or what It might be a little early to leave a review but I think its important again to explain this in detail Right now Ive got a lot of doubt but will give it a couple days and Ill report back One thing I really dont like is right now when I press dock it went the complete wrong way and decided to not dock I liked the Waze vacuum cleaner because it went right to its home and knew everything was I hope this works out better than my first impression,4,46 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2024",True
B09T4YZGQR,Great little robot cleans all our hardwood floors Great customer service too,When my wife and I downsized to a home with about 1000 square feet of living space we knew we wanted a robot vacuum to keep the 80yearold white oak floors clean We wanted four things from our robot A selfemptying dustbin and charging station to have it connect to Alexa so we could verbally have her tell the robot to start cleaning and to be able to tell it to go clean one or more specific rooms  Roomba and Shark both have systems that can do all those things We chose this Shark IQ system because there were lots of reviews saying they did a better job on hard floors and because the Shark vacuum is quite a bit less expensive  We have no regrets The Shark IQ is a great system for our needs It will clean all six rooms on our main level and our two small hallways on a single charge it efficiently navigates its way back to the selfempty charging base to empty its dustbin when it fills up then returns to where it left off and finishes the job and returns to its base to empty again and recharge  Alexa integration is pretty good too When my wife or I leave for a long walk or to run errands we ask Alexa to Tell Shark to start cleaning then tell her  Rosie Jetson the name we gave our Shark when she asks Which robot and off Rosie goes By the time we get back the vacuuming is done Yay  Some reviewers have claimed their Shark was not able to map out their homes floorplan We didnt have that problem After about a week of cleaning our home Rosie Jetson had mapped our floor plan Once that was done I spent a few minutes outlining each of our rooms in the Shark Android app gave the rooms names kitchen dining room etc and that was it  Once our floorplan was entered we could ask Alexa to Tell Shark to clean the kitchen Then after clinging to the left wall of our living and dining room and navigating around our dining room chair legs Rosie makes it to the kitchen vacuums and returns to base Job done Awesome  OK Now its time to tell you the sad stuff Rosie was not our first Shark IQ robot The first unit we received from Amazon was a refurbished unit and it was defective Our first Shark would not connect to our home WiFi so it could not communicate with Alexa my smartphone or map out our floorplan We called Shark for technical support and after trying to troubleshoot our robot for 30 minutes Shark Tech Support declared our original unit deadonarrival and sent us a brandnew replacement selfemptying Shark system The replacement works like a charm and Sharks customer support was excellent  There are also some things Rosie doesnt do well She doesnt sweep nto and vaccume all the way into corners and other spaces she cant fit into including a cornet next to our sofa that has an end table with legs that are too close together for her she gets tangled up in lamp and extension cords more on that in a moment we have a set of lightweight nesting occasional tables that she pushes around an inch or two each time she bumps into themand my wifes tennis shoes which live under our dresser get rearranged and pushed to the back against the wall when she vacuums  I addressed the problem with lamp and extension cords by buying a cord protectorcover and will build a little wooden square of 1x2 furring strips to put under our dresser so my wifes shoes dont get pushed to the back Simple fixes but you should be aware that robot vacuums arent smart enough yet to avoid these shortcomings  So heres our bottom line Were really happy with Rosie Jetson our Shark IQ robot vacuum  Pros  Does a great job of vacuuming our hardwood floors and the carpet mats at our two entries  Maps the floorplans and can be told to vacuum a specific room  Self empties its own dustbin into the charging base  Cleanings can be scheduled using the Shark app  Responds to voice commands to start cleaning via Alexa or Google Home  Cons  Pushes lightweight things around sometimes  Cannot clean into corners or tight spaces so youll still need to vacuume manually now and them  Dirt doesnt just disappear You have to empty the selfemptying base now and then You also occasionally need to clean the floor brush particularly if you have household members with long hair  Rosie Jetson the Robot Maid from the Saturday Morning Jetson Cartoons I grew up with could dust too Our Shark robot doesnt even try  Maybe next year Shark people,5,100 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2021",True
B09T4YZGQR,Works well except vacuuming gets slightly better every day,Update 8 My robot has developed a leg fetish see video can someone recommend a good therapist for robots  Update 7 Cleans well except for any of the following when 14 to 12 long thread yarn Doritos felt etc I think it just needs a better brush Id trade the current tangle resistance brush for a brush that helped clean better any day It is fun at parties though Guest 1 drops a Dorito Guest 2 steps on Dorito I call Alexa tell Shark to clean dining room Guests laugh hysterically as Shark IQ drives over Dorito fragments leaving them undisturbed  Update 6 When you press the Play labeled Clean button in the Shark app if you pick the option to clean up to 3 specific rooms you cannot clean the last room entered on the map it wont let you scroll that far they put the button over that option so you can scroll it into view but you cant hold the scroll position in view with one finger while clicking the option with the other if you let go of the position to click the option it goes back behind the button so you cannot click it  So make sure the last thing you add to the map is a nogo area so that all of the other rooms are options when sending Shark to clean manually you can always clean the hidden room via Alexa though  Update 5 Mapping has completed  Labeling rooms is not intuitive after you add each room it makes you rename all of the previous rooms you already defined and labeled as follows Define room 1 give it a name define room 2 give room 1 a name give room 2 a name define room 3 give room 1 a name give room 2 a name give room 3 a name   So I have my rooms defined I have one Shark IQ set up I can send my Shark to clean a specific room as follows paraphrasing because I dont remember the exact wording Me Alexa ask Shark to clean the Family Room Alexa Which Shark vacuum would you like me to use Me Shark  Thats right I have one Shark and I named it Shark but every time I tell Alexa to do something with my Shark it asks me to pick a Shark out of the following set of Sharks Shark  Shark app will not let you schedule cleaning of a room or a set of rooms  You can schedule when to clean everything you cant schedule when to clean something  I want Shark to start cleaning after everyone has left for school and work and I want it to finish before anyone gets back  Unfortunately because it takes about 25 hours to clean my house between emptying and charging it finishes around 6 pm We start getting home from work and school around 2 pm  So I tried scheduling rooms through Alexa Routines  The only way you can schedule the Shark skill in Alexa is to schedule Alexa to ask you what you want the Shark to do  I tried using Google Assistant as outlined in the documentation found in the Shark app but Google Assistant cant find the Shark ROBOT service as described in the Shark IQ documentation  But I was able to schedule cleaning of 3 rooms a day so that the robot is always dormant while we are at home and every room gets cleaned every 24 hours  I used Google Assistant Routines to have Google Assistant tell Alexa what to tell the Shark to do it works flawlessly  The hard part was setting up 10 Say something commands for each schedule First Say  something command tells Alexa which room needs to be vacuumed the next 8 Say something commands in each Routine I put four spaces in not sure if quantity matters that pause Google Assistant long enough for Alexa to ask which of my one robots I want it to use and the last Say command says Shark  So to schedule my Shark IQ to clean specific rooms at specific times on specific days I put a Google Mini next to an Echo Dot and the Google Assistant takes care of the schedule the Google Mini tells the Echo Dot what to do the Echo Dot then tells the Shark what to do Rube Goldberg would be proud  Update 4 Scheduled runs often fail complaining  cannot run because its dust cup is missing So I may need to find the dust bin sensor and hard wire it to always report present since it often reports missing even though dust bin is properly inserted and latched The only time I have ever removed the dust bin was to clear dust cup error  Update 3 New firmware today V341120191015V3618m149Oct 26 2019MesaM1820MesaB011S20107 I wish they would publish change logs  Update 2 This is what I want before I give this product 5 stars some of these features probably already exist for this product already but wont be enabled until mapping is complete 1 Ability to get rid of BotBoundaries and instead draw boundaries on map 2 Ability to give robot verbal hints about where a new dry spill is as in Alexa tell Shark to clean Kitchen Southwest What Id like that to do is imagine that each room has 9 dots NW N NE W Center E SW S SE Center is default  When you send it to a room it starts at the dot specified where W and E caused it to clean a third of the room first traveling N to S and S to N N and S cleans a third traveling W to E and E to W and NW NE SW and SE start by cleaning a quarter of the room and sending to the center cleans third of the room first either traveling N to S or W to E whatever it normally does when cleaning the whole floor This way when you want to clean up a spill of dry goods you can send it to the point of nine closest to the spill in that room to start 3 Ability to see location of robot on map in app Helpful when you need to find robot for any reason but you cant hear in stereo For me using the existing find robot feature is like playing the game hotter colder as it only tells me if Im getting closer or not each time it plays sound because I cant hear in stereo  Update 1 After I wrote my original review I noticed that the cleaning history was updating but the app said that it couldnt connect to my Shark So I now think that there really was just an issue with Sharks servers Day 1 no connectivity issues Day after posting my review no connectivity issues The Shark has cleaned my house 25 times but says map is only 40 complete The incomplete map that it wont let me edit yet looks 100 accurate and 100 complete So Im raising my rating from 1 star to 4 stars instead of 5 Next week if mapping still isnt finished Ill lower it to 2 After mapping is complete and Ive been able to test all the features I might raise rating to five stars So far it has cleaned house well on schedule alerts me at work when it gets stuck now averages getting stuck less than once a day so I can send one of my kids to get it up and running again I wish it came with three times as much BotBoundary  Original As soon as it installed firmware version V341020190826V36151321Aug 27 2019MesaM182MesaB011S20102 it could no longer stay connected to WiFi so to control this vacuum by smartphone or voice you need a WiFi robot capable of turning the Shark IQ RV1001AE off waiting 10 seconds then turning it back on  I have two subnetsSSIDs one mesh Google WiFi one not Google Fibers Built in WiFi  None of my other wifi devices at home have any trouble staying connected to either network  Ive tried my Shark on both since the firmware upgrade it disconnects from both  So it can still vacuum the whole house on a schedule returning to base to empty and to charge on its own  I just dont get notifications when it gets stuck and I cant send it to go clean a specific room in my house without first walking over to the charging base turning the vacuum off waiting a few seconds and then turning it back on  If the noisy vacuum interrupts a conversation I cant pause it with my phone I have to get up and press the Dock button or turn it off  Also when it gets stuck it usually gets stuck right when it starts working as one of its wheels will slide off the side of the charging base ramp pad and somehow get stuck on the of the pad with the stuck wheel on the carpet but the ribbed side of the wheel stuck on the corner of the ramp,3,353 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States

B09T4YZGQR,Overall very happy with this product,My Usage and Overall Comments   Have had the Bot for 23 weeks now  Mostly used on 2nd floor bedroomsbathroomsLoft area which is 90 carpet  I mapped this floor only  Occasionally used on 1st floor which is about 50 carpet Not mapped  Overall it seems to do a pretty good job keeping in mind these Bot Vacs are not meant for DEEP cleaning carpets  Much quieter than my old Neato Botvac80  Cleans my 2nd floor on a single charge with BOOST cleaning and recharging takes about 3 hours  Overall I feel its a good Robot Vac but wouldnt spend more than 300 for it  Floor Mapping Review    My 2nd floor is about 1000sq ft and it takes about 1012 mins to map it   Its not the greatest at mapping  It will sometimes take 23 Explore runs for it to get it right because it   occasionally misses entire wall sections   AddingChangingRemoving Room Labels and NoGo Zones on the app is pretty easy   If youre older its easier to do it on a Tablet vs the phone   I noticed that once it completes the entire cleaning run on the 2nd floor it seems like it internally compares the results   with the full map and if it detects areas that it missed it will go back to them to clean them   When it does do that it doesnt always clean them in the most efficient order often running from one end of the   house to the other to address these areas  I have also seen this behavior when tasked with cleaning a specific room   Its will sometimes bounce around in the room getting the spots it feels it missed   There have been times where Ive seen it do several clockwisecounterclockwise spins in the same spot as if its trying   to decide where to go next  Sometimes these crazy spins can last 3040 seconds   So far no problems with it finding the Base Unit and Docking with it   Mapping is only required if you need to specify NoGo Zones or want the ability to vac a specific rooms so you CAN   do like in my case map the most commonly vacuumed floor ie 2nd floor then manually initiate a cleaning for the 1st floor   see more about mapping in my CONS section  Detailed Review   PROS   Its fairly quiet  You can actually have a conversation standing next to it as its cleaning   Their SHARK CLEAN app is easy to use  Again if you are older using it on a Tablet larger screen0 will be a better experience   The selfvacuuming  evacuation unit works well typically removing 95 of the bot vacs contents   So far have not had any issues with it getting stuck in a corner going over room thresholdstransitions etc   Bump avoidance it pretty good as long as objects are high enough for the Lidar Sensor to see it   No issues transitioning between carpet and hardwoodtile surfaces   Although it may not take the most efficient paths on occasion and sometimes recleans a sections 23 times during its total run   it does appear to do a very through clean cleaning all the places that it possibly can reach   It does well respecting NoGo Zones   Ledge detection works well also but the falloff is only detected after about 25 of the bot is hanging over the edge  depending on its speed   It can be nerve wracking to watch near stairs   The Evacuate and Resume feature is nice to have  After every 30 mins of cleaning it will return to the Dock to empty its dust bin then   return to clean where it left off   The Do Not Disturb Schedule works well   The NoGo Zones work well   Although I have not had a need for it as of yet Im confident the Recharge and Resume feature will work fine   FYI   Initial WiFi Setup  I did have an issue trying to pair the Bot with my phone  I think after I rebooted my phone it finally worked   Annoying  if you remove the Bots dust bin while its ON it will complain stating its dust bin needs to be replaced   The foam roll filter in the Docking station gets VERY dirty real fast and needs to be cleaned every 23 runs   Its easy to clean just tap over a garbage can to get the bulk off then slide off the foam roll from its base and rinse in a sink   Let dry completely before returning to docking station   The Evacuation system will engage EVERY TIME you return the Bot to the dock  So if you pull the Bot off just to check the roller as soon as you   redock it the evacuation system will turn on   The Evacuation system is as loud as a typical upright vacuum so keep that in mind when deciding on a location for it   I have not tried the SCHEDULED Cleaning at all  I personally prefer to manually initiate whenwhere I want it to clean   CONS   I was not able to Register the Bot via the app  kept saying Something went wrong  Had to do it online   The app could use some improvementsupdating like showing the current location of the BOT and what its cleaned so far as its running   estimated time of completion etc   Deleting your map when you want to do a Reexplore ie ReMap can take a minute or two to complete   Matrix cleaning can only be performed on one room at a time  So if you have 3 kids bedrooms you want to Matrix clean you have to select one   do the cleaning then send it out again to do the Matrix cleaning on the 2nd bedroom etc   You might be able to work around this by setting up 3 Scheduled cleanings one for each room   The Mapping system could be MUCH better  I can understand it not mapping a shoe on the floor but missing an entire 10FOOT WALL SECTION   Would be nice to have MultiFloorLevel mapping also   Ive run into an occasional issue where after doing a manual cleaning via press of the CLEAN button on the 1st floor not mapped   then using the app to vac a specific room on the 2nd floor mapped it will clean the room but then starts recleaning the last 3foot section   overandover until I manually stop it  Others also have reported odd issues jumping between Mapped cleaning and nonMapped cleaning areas   The fix for me was to delete my map and have the bot do a reexplore to build it again and hope it does it correctly on the 1st pass   If this issue continues Im toying with the idea of not doing any mapping at all and just letting the Bot figure it out as it goes regardless of the floor its on   Ill loose the NoGo Zones and Specific Room Clean functions and it will likely take longer to run   but it might be worth it until the Mapping Logic is improved  CUSTOMER SUPPORT   I did reach out to them when I had the recleaning the same 3foot section issue after bouncing between a Mapped and UnMapped floor  This was during Black Friday weekend and I only waited 510 minutes to speak with someone  They were OK some easier to understand than others  I was eventually connected with one of their Technical Support staff and had to reexplain the issue  He asked if I could run the cleaning session  again I was fine with that and he wanted to video record the Bot in action so he sent me a link for the video connection  I was unable to get  that working Android phone issue  He asked me to reexplain the issue to him again and we got into a brief disagreement about how the MATRIX CLEAN  function worked  he claimed that was only for Spot cleaning which I told him was NOT true  He finally suggested I delete my floor map and rerun another mapping session then try to replicate the problem again  I was assigned a Ticket to reference when I called them back with my findings  After redoing the mapping I havent been able to replicate the problem yet and Im leaning towards assuming the Bot works best with Mapped areas only  and jumping between MappedNonMapped floors is not 100 supported,5,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8,

B09T4YZGQR,Cant say enough about how awesome this is,Let me start by saying I HATED robot vacuums before getting this  I had bought an early model from another brand and it would randomly run until it hit something turn and repeat  This was basically useless  It never really cleaned and was constantly stuck or ran out of batteries before finding its way back to the base  This couldnt be more different  Setup  I was tentative from the start  But I told it to start mapping and forgot about it  15 minutes later I saw it on the base and assumed I never started it or it failed so I opened the app and saw a highly detailed map of my house  I was amazed  It had mapped and returned to the base so quick I assume it didnt work  I used my phone and assigned room boundaries to the map put a DO NOT GO zone over the basement stairs to be safe and setup the app to auto vacuum at 6am on MWF  Running  I have had only one time it needed intervention  It sucked a small cat toy into the roller and detected the strain on the motor and stopped asked for help  It took about 60 seconds to open the roller remove it remove the toy and put it back together  It resumed the process and finished  I have had it for months and that is the only time I have intervened  Vacuum quality Each time I empty the bin I am horrified at the amount of dust and cat hair that it is picking up  It is running 3x a week and in one week it takes a kitten worth of hair off the hard wood and enough dust to make you queasy looking at it  It is a powerful vacuum it gets the entire house when it runs and does a great job but it is quiet enough to run without waking anyone up  Pros Setup simple  Set and forget  Empty once a week or two or three  Almost no human intervention required  I dont prep for vacuuming dont tidy up dont do anything  It just works and works well  Lidar constantly updating the map it rarely touches anything so it doesnt scratch walls and furniture it uses sensors and lidar to see the obstacles and work around them  Cons It takes a recharge to fully do the house  We work from home and I cant tell it the order to vacuum So sometimes our offices are the last rooms and by the time it runs recharges and starts the second half I am already working and it wants to come vacuum my office  If I could set the order of room vacuuming it would be literally perfect  That is the ONLY con I can possibly think of  Seriously it is THAT good  I dont know what the 1000 models can do that this cant,5,49 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2024",True
B09T4YZGQR,New to Robot Vacuums,Since I cant leave a 45 out of 5 stars Ill go ahead and just round down and here is why  Let me first preface this by saying I had a huge bias against purchasing a robot vacuum I honestly thought they were useless unable to adequately clean the house and would be built to be more of a remote control car than an actual cleaning device  WellPrime Day comes along and this bad boy is on sale and I figured Id take a shot at it I have a husky and I spend most of my evenings sweeping the floor  CONSTANTLY It would get so bad especially during the summers where Id just be exhausted from work gym and dinner that I would avoid sweeping until the next day or the day after I eventually transitioned to using my vacuum which helped a little but I found myself going through the process of still sweeping then vacuuming to pick up any missed particles of hair fuzz or dust  SoI bought this guy and omg its been a godsend I run this bad boy every three days and my house is noticeably cleaner and smells better I can literally relax and play with my dog while the robot is cruising around the house picking up everything I was impressed by the amount it picked up As a result of the frequency I find less and less hairdirtfuzz on the floor Dont get me wrong I still use my broom and hand held vacuum but thats usually on the weekends when I do a much deeper clean of the home However it takes less time because there is so much less mess on the floor I still speculate that the robot isnt 100 but I guess neither am I HAHAHA  Pros  Cleans my 900 sqft home in about 40 minutes Able to pick up dust fur dirt and crumbs from the floor with no issues havent tried larger objects  The wheels are like hidden monster truck wheels and are independent of each other so that it can traverse over carpet and other slightly elevated areas  The app allows a full map of your house as well as creating or sectioning off your home so that the if you want to vacuum specific areas in my case the kitchen and game room where my husky usually sleeps or hangs out it will clean the area and be done  The speed settings are pretty nifty too and can be adjusted to get a much thorough cleaning  Cons  This could be my fear but due to the warning about liquids on the floor I have to do a preclean to make sure there isnt spots of drool from my dog or areas where I may have dropped water from washing dishes etc I also have to ensure that all the wires and stuff on the floor are put away to make sure the robot doesnt get caught  The battery seems a little bit of a drain One cleaning reduces the battery all the way to 60 not sure if thats normal but I figured since its new itll be at maybe 80 or have a power save function  The collecting bin should come with some cleaning instruction I want to make sure this bad boy stays with me for a long while so I like to learn how to keep the seal that keeps the bin closed tight remains in tact Its made of like a soft sponge material and feel itll degrade after a few dumps well see  After researching a few models I wish this also had the swiffer pad attachment or something so that it could polish or mop the floor as well I know it doesnt always pick up the super tiny dust bunnies but that pad would be amazing  Overall I give it a solid 90 Ive only had it for a little over a month and I hope I have many years with this thing If you havent given a robot vacuum a try Id definitely recommend itcoming from someone that despised them,4,12 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2024",True
B09T4YZGQR,Best purchase for our home so far,Since we bought this in late November which I suggest getting since it was newely half off its retail price of 600 gotta love black Friday I have only had to get out the old vacuum once I was worried that we would have to get it out more than that to get under our cabinets in the kitchen but that is luckily not a problem If I see something under there now I just push it to the middle of the floor if I know shark is going to clean that day  So here we go  Pros it literally cleans about 95 of your floors Hair is not a problem tangling on the roller is not a problem larger debris is generally not a problem I had some things here and there get missed the first go around but I mostly see that it has problems on carpets which we have mostly hardwood floors so not a big deal it mapped out our first floor which is sizeable in about 2 go cleanings I was worried about this as a large amount of reviews stated that it took 30 or more cleanings to map their house out and it still didnt map it correctly The one thing I noticed about these reviews is that they are mostly from from a year ago so Im assuming that there has been a software update since then to address this issue It was super efficient at mapping  I see this as a pro but some might not is that it teaches you to adjust your cleanliness behaviors You need to keep the floors free of obstacles as much as possible in order for this robot to do its job which means moving your shoes picking up toys moving chairs etc It was good for my wife and i to adapt better habits anyway and this was a good way to Kickstart that for our household  if you have allergies this thing picks up a ton of dust Since we dont have a pet yet it mostly picks up some food hair and dust on the floor Man does it help My allergies have been much better over the past 2 months  some people gave the app negative reviews but I found it helpful overall It is simple easy and quick to make adjustments on you really dont have to empty this but once a month And honestly I could get away with maybe once every 2 months instead Dont forget to do a monthly maintenance check and clean the filter but this is a 5 minute routine once a month Much easier than busting out the bulky vacuum all the time  CONS speaking of the app it needs a no go zone feature The magnet strips while great dont effectively help in managing the bots path all the time Make sure to tape it or use 3m sticky stuff to keep it on the floor otherwise your bot will try to suck it up and take it for a ride with it The no go zone feature would be helpful for wire areas furniture or kid play areas I hear it is supposed to come along sometime in the future hopefully soon carpet cleaning is a little bit of an issue We have a giant area rug in our living room and it sometimes has issues with picking up stuff Luckily the bot does 2 or 3 sweeps which most times gets the debris or fuzzies on our carpet but not all the time This is indicated on YouTube reviews that I watched before I purchased this so I knew what to expect it is slightly noisy and takes a while to clean I advise to make the schedule while you are not home because it can change your daily routine pattern Generally it takes about an hour and a half to clean our 600 square foot first floor I keep it on normal mode but there is a higher power suction mode that is louder So get ready to turn the volume up on your TV I did hear from a roomba user though that this bot is quieter so I guess its subjective this is more if a personal gripe it might not be a big deal for you but I was hoping to have a meet the Jetsons vibe when I connected it to my alexa I wanted to say alexa clean the kitchen and it do just that Unfortunately it doesnt do different room commands it just does its normal full routine You can do this through the shark app which is simple and easy enough So designate room names and tell it to clean just that room Still if you have a kitchen mess and you want to use verbal commands through alexa skills to do something while you are continuing chores or cooking it would be a nice touch if it did it Oh well thats just me  Overall a great purchase Currently I got mine for roughly 315 and I am doing monthly payments with Amazon which I love this feature of Amazons payments I pay it off in March in monthly installments of 64 bucks It is worth the money compared to those roombas that cause double or triple the shark bot I did a ton of research on different vacuums and this one is in the top 5 as of right now I highly recommend this to anyone with similar lay out as us mostly hard wood floors with area rugs I found the cons to be just nit picking at its performance and overall it makes our life 80x easier I give it a 45 out 5 for my personal home and I hope this review was helpful  1 year update  Dog hair Still going strong and still highly recommend for those with mostly hard wood floors or linoleum In fact I recommended it to my mom and dad and now they have one and love it We did finally get to test it with some serious dog hair We had an Australian Shepard which has super thick and clingy fur and another dog that visited for several days Both are extremely active and were all over our floors and our one carpet area They left a ton of fur and it did take 3 or 4 cleanings to get up about 80 of the hair Whatever was left over was bunched up on the carpet and was easily removable thanks to shark Just be prepared to wait a few days for the fur to be cleaned up in the carpet If its hardwood then it is cleaned up instantly  Hair and roller blade I have not had any issues with the roller blades and hair tangling I had to untangle some hair that rolled to the center twice It is an easy fix Take scissors and a quick snip and boom solved the problem The big thing is that it doesnt hinder the cleaning ability of the vacuum  Parts I havent had to replace any of the parts yet on it Just keep up with monthly maintenance and it will hold up Clean the filters and the dust cup monthly and it will run smoothly The battery life is still the same too No issues with battery degradation  Errors and software stuff so the errors are minor with this robot It is the occasional bumper is stuck and that the dust cup needs to be emptied which is nice if you forget to keep up with maintenance The only issue I have with the software is that it used to be able to clean specific rooms when I originally got it but now it doesnt allow me to do that at all Its a bummer since sometimes I still stuff in the kitchen and I just want it to do that room not an entire cleaning  again Also and this is a small gripe but I wish that I could have the robot automatically go to max suction mode every cleaning Instead I have to go to my shark app on my phone and change it from normal mode which is its default cleaning mode  to max  Overall  I would still say this is a 45 out of 5 Minor issues but still totally worth it,5,966 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2021",True
B09T4YZGQR,Navigation is excellent  dustbin cleanout not so much,We just received the robot yesterday February 3 2023 so this is a preliminary review Setup was straightforward as was connection to wifi and the app on my phone  My biggest concerns are with the app not the Robot itself  First there are few directions within the app Thus I had to search through the various menus and randomly press buttons in an effort to find something Then on several occasions I found the item I wanted to find wouldnt show up at all until the robot completed its first full cleaning Its a learning curve I know but they could have helped a lot more than they did  Then after the robot completed the first cleaning magically a map of the house appeared and once I got the image turned rightside up it was simple to name the rooms But herein lies a small issue The app provides a list of room labels to choose from but there appears to be no provision for customizing names Hence my wifes sewing room became the Playroom  I knew there was a place to set the robots suction power Eco Normal Max and after 20 minutes of researching I found it However the setting appears to apply to all the rooms to be cleaned This is fine if you have all carpet or all smooth surfaces Most of our floors are smooth but the master bedroom is a rather deep pile carpet  The app allows you to name each room and send the robot off to clean all several or just one This is nice But having that capability without the ability to set the suction level for each room separately seems rather braindead  Thats my compaints so far Lets move on to the more positive aspects of the robot  I mentioned the fairly deep pile carpet in the bedroom The robot handled it with aplomb There was a noticeable change in speed and ease of operation but it pushed through without a whimper I had it on normal power and would prefer Max but will try that later  The map it produced was remarkably good for a single cleaning run and I could easily determine which room was which once I got it rightside up   a single cleaning run could be misleading Two full charges were needed to complete the cleaning  The app does provide a decent report of the robots activity  It started cleaning at 956 am then briefly docked 30 min later orientation  and resumed cleaning after emptying its dust bin The battery ran low about 30 after 83 minutes of cleaning time 3 hr and 15 min were required for the battery to recharge It then cleaned with an intermediate docking for nearly 2 hours where it died in our bathroom with 5 charge showing in the app We carried it back to the docking station where it  exhausted the debris and began recharging 65 hours were required from staart to finish This isnt good or bad Its just information for you  The app says 2276 sq ft were cleaned This is about twice too much About 1350 sq ft gross outside dimensions were available but that includes closets furniture bathtubs etc that block the robot I did notice that it systematically recleaned numerous areas on the second charge So I dont think their numbers are wrong just duplicated  Its ability to navigate appears to be excellent It does travel in long precisely straight lines when it can Though it seems to turn around at about 20  regardless When it approaches a wall or furniture it will slow and gently tap the barrier or turn just before reaching the item It typically turns corners around furniture efficiently though there is sometimes a bit of wasted spinning around  Except for the time where it ran out of juice it effortlessly relocated the dock to recharge and empty the onboard dust bin  We have a pet cat with 2 fur very fine fur that sheds constantly There is no reason that cat isnt totally bald The roller brush and side brushes seemed to handle it well Both were relatively free  of her fur I know I will have to clean the axels and the roller every few weeks but it should be tolerable  If I think of it Ill add to this review at a later date  So here is an update Its now April 21 2023 and Im still very pleased with the machine It seems to do a good job on our hard surfaced floors as it seldom misses visible debris The degree of cleaning on our carpets is harder to know but the dust bin always contains an abundance of cat hair Speaking of cat hair the roller NEVER clogs with cat hair However the axles on the roller do collect hair I have to clean them every 23 weeks as the machine stops and says my roller is clogged That said the roller axles are very easy to clean No tools are needed since the roller cover just snaps in and out and the roller then lifts out nicely exposing the axles and housings Though a small pick is needed to clean one end of the axle  The shark never gets caught in a corner or tight spot when there is a path out Our Neato used to get caught frequently for no good reason The shark has gotten caught a few times on cords shoe laces etc and twice has run up on the track of our patio door and gotten stuck but it is vastly better at returning to the base station than our Neato  I have the Extended Clean option turned on which tells the Shark to continue cleaning until it needs charging Lately it has run out of power a few times and had to be manually returned to the base station  I will try it with extended clean Off This may cause it to take longer to clean the house but may increase reliability  The attached photo illustrates the depth of pile in our carpet as well as the manner in which it cleans The shark is quite systematic when cleaning but it does sometimes cover some areas twice  We have some open grates on our floor and the Shark traverses them without issue The Neato would stop on them and discontinue cleaning so we had to use the magnetic strips supplied to avoid this issue The shark recognizes the magnetic strips but they arent needed for the grates  I empty the dust bin on the base station probably once every 3 weeks which works fine Thats all for now  Heres another update It is now January 10 2024 and the Shark has 11 months under its belt It started doing weird thingserrors after about 6 months so I replaced the battery which was needed with our Neato and it took care of our problem It continues to perform well until it picks up a small rock or pea sized chunk of dog food which happens frequently now that we were forced to change our little dogs food for medical reasons The shark does pick up these items but they fail to exhaust into the dustbin and lodge either in the throat of the dustbin or get stuck in the spring loaded door on the Shark When that happens an error occurs and the shark ceases operation This issue is simple to fix However the most annoying thing is after clearing the blockage the Shark doesnt pickup where it left off I have to  select the rooms that were missed very nice capability by the way and tell it to start cleaning again  May 14 2024 The shark as near as I can tell continues to function normally However the dustbins failure to empty and subsequent error messages that prevent the unit from continuing to clean has finally pushed me over the edge It is rare that the entire set of rooms get vacuumed Most days I have to restart the machine at least once during the cleaning cycle and then it forgets where to restart The bottom line is its too frustrating to use now and its going in the trash,4,309 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2023",True

B00CH9QWOU,great product one of the best purchases if you drink coffee,We have had the unit for 8 months now its been through 4 cleaning cycles 2 descaling 2 normal backflow so Ive tested out most of the possible functions it has We like it a lot  If it dies this year it is probably a breakeven so far based on the number of times weve used it vice buying from coffee shops  At 5 a cup you have to buy at least 120 cups to even do a simple breakeven  Of course using milksubstitute and other items at home adds to this cost  Assume that you have to run 200 cups at home that you otherwise would have bought elsewhere and you have basically done a breakeven  If you drive to get to the coffee shop and buy other things then it may save you a lot of money sooner  In my opinion this unit easily costs less than what we would have done within a year  The grinder seems to do a great job and the dials to alter the size and amount work well  I have had to clean it once since the grinds seemed to be working poorly on Brevilles recommendation running rice through the unit and then cleaning it removing the screw from the top helped  We have not tried other machines having been satisfied with the reviews and price of this one as listed  So far just great results  We tend to do espresso drinks each time meaning we use the grinder frother and espresso for each drink  The machine would likely last longer with less maintenance needed if you just did espresso and used preground beans or had a separate grinder most likely  Family of 2 with kid in general we probably push through 46 cups a day on average and up to 9 max at times  If we have guests maybe 1012 but not often  While we would certainly have NOT been buying this many from the local brewhouse the quality of the product is just great  We choose to use almond milk exclusively as our base and we make it ourselves so the quality of the milk will never be that of the rich and creamy milk frothed up but it is still amazing  This machine does a great job of grinding pushing hot water and frothing so we get a cup that literally is as good as we ever had anywhere and with the quality we want  Most coffee shops when they do have milk substitutes use poor quality almond milk anyhow and it affects the taste  If you havent tried making your own almond milk its extremely easy  dont bother unless you buy good almonds from Spain or California  Soak them called sprouting then blend 1 cup almonds to 4 cups milk  Then strain through a nut milk bag or cheesecloth and add 23TB honey vanilla bean pinch salt cinnamon  Blend  Some folks have gently heated the almond milk on a stove which helps thicken it a bit and actually makes it more of a milk consistency than the almond juice that you get by just straining  Lots of different options and chefs are still coming up with ways to handle this  But frankly after doing the almond milk thing we will not use anything else  Some folks also add some coconut creme to the mix and it also thickens things a bit  There are excellent non dairy and healthy alternatives out there and they work shockingly well  We also pretty much gave up on buying beans from local brewhouses we found the quality and taste not as good as we could do ourselves so off we went and bought a small roaster Fresh Roast SR700 Home Coffee Roaster and frankly this make the cycle complete  not only can we buy green coffee beans via amazon very cheaply but we can also control how much we roast and when we use them making it a very turnkey and enjoyable experience  I advise also buying the Knockbox from Breville  this is a great add on and helps you control the waste from the Portafilter  Great toolwastebasket and helps you inadvertently throw your grinds into the drain not good if you have a septic system either  Agree with prior posters  use fresh beans and consider roasting your own  The best bean weve found so far is the Colombian Huila also sold on Amazoncom  5lb bag for 30 shipped  For about 6 a pound you will have plenty of opportunity to find the roast level you want  Reason we like this particular bean other than being available on amazoncom when roasted to near or after second crack it has a nice caramelchocolate aftertaste to it  Not a bean expert here but weve tried a dozen or so varieties and for the price and availability this is a really well priced and nice tasting bean  As mentioned before weve done the local brewhouse roasted beans and its basically russian roulette and weve yet to find an awesome tasting bean from them  The breville has a multiple of ways you can alter the taste by changing the temperature grind and amount of water through the bean but some beans just arent suited for espresso it seems  Ill let the experts deal with that  once we find one that is suitable we work more on the base taste which is mostly affected by the milkmilk substitute that you use unless you are just doing straight shots of espresso  We like the machine so much its worth considering taking with you on travel if you have the power and way to store your own milk at your location  And yes weve been at places with inroom espresso machines like the Ritz which has inroom espresso from Nespresso to places that have full kitchens with a variety of machines and places with club level places that have fully automatic machines  We continue to be underwhelmed with the quality and taste that most places do  Yes weve been in Italy and had the best espressocappuccinos and they cant be beaten due to the location ambiance etc  This machine does a bang up job of that without the expense of travel  lol  Frankly Breville has provided a cost point and quality machine that is hard to beat  Other than my calling for help on a small grind questionissue I have had no service issues yet  From other posters if there are substantial issues that start to creep up after the 1 year mark its kind of a cost tradeoff to consider paying 250 for a repair or just buying a new one  I guess there is also a warranty you can buy if bought through Amazon that goes up to 4 years so that may be an option to keep it running longer and truly have cost savings for many years to come,5,261 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2016",True
B00CH9QWOU,Best Entrylevel Home Espresso Machine,I absolutely love this machine With as many lattes as I drink this will easily pay for itself within a year inclouding the cost of beans milk and cleaning products  Notes Make sure to keep up with all the regular maintenance  Ever day after Ive made my coffee I wipe the steam wand purge it then wipe again Make sure to get into all the crevices around the tip and youll never need to use the pin to clean out the tip Once Ive done that and poured my steamed milk I purge the showerhead by pulling one shot into the empty mug no filters This keeps the showerhead clean of coffee debris and keeps the coffee tasting pure  REMEMBER TO CHANGE YOUR WATER FILTERS The filters should be changed every 60 uses or 2 months whichever comes first This wolill reduce how often you need to descale the machine prolong its useful life and provide better tasting coffees You will still need to descale the machine every so often The manual included is very helpful for keeping up with the maintenance as well as pulling shots making drinks and other useful tips and you can also find instructions on their website should you misplace the manual Gold tone makes pretty inexpensive replacement filters specific to this machine and theyre available here on Amazon I use them and am pretty happy with the results  Do not let the water run out Ever This could cause serious damage to the machine If you forget once or twice youll probably be just fine but check the water reservoir at least 12 times per week  Clean the machine parts at least once a week You may need to empty and rinse the drip tray 12 times a week depending on frequency of use but take it out and hand wash at least once a week This is a good time to wash the tools and tool bin as well Also dont forget to take the coffee filters out of the portafilter and wash those as well Over time residue can build up underneath there Also the spouts in the portafiler twist off so you can clean them better Clean out your parts get in those crevices regularly and youll be just fine  Dont forget to clean the hopper and grinder You should clean it out every time you switch to a new bean or at least every few pounds of coffee The instructions in the manual are pretty easy and straight forward I also use a clean dry towel to wipe any remaining coffee and oils from both the grinder parts and the hopper Do not wash in warm water as you could risk it not drying well and rusting or not being lubricated enough and over heating Just use the included brush and clean dry paper towels You could also vacuum out residual coffee from the grinder to assist in cleaning but I dont usually need to  Also remember that the stainless exterior is stainless plating This means it can wear over time and not look as nice The best way to handle this is to wipe it down with a damp cloth once daily then more detailed once a week and follow it up by drying it with a clean towel This will prolong the exterior appearance Also during your weekly cleaning be sure to look under where the coffee and steam come out and clean around there Milk coffee and residue steam can splatter and build up so be sure to clean it as well The weekly cleaning sound intensive but really takes maybe 5 minutes  Common issues Keep in mind certain orings will need to be replaced over time This is noted by Breville in the manual and on the website There are two main places where you need to replace these around the tip of the portafilter where the spouts connect and where the portafilter connects to pull shots  Another common issue is that the machine will make a loud 34buzzing34 sound andor leak water out of the bottom of the machine This is a common issue and when it does occur usually happens around 6 months to a year This generally occurs due to a broken solenoid valve If your product is still under warranty take a video and contact their customer service Maybe suggest its a solenoid valve and they are usually very good about fixing or replacing the machines and parts If it is no longer under warranty and they will not resolve the issue because sometimes they still will after the warranty period there are many repair services that can fix this If you are especially handy and brave enough to fix it yourself you can usually find the replacement parts fairly cheaply online not just the valve but really ANY part that may need to be replaced Again if its still under warranty do not go this route as it will void any existing warranty Also if you dont know what youre doing you could do more damage than good  Allinall this is an amazing machine for this price point There is a reason this machine is so popular and highly rated Theres a lot of customization available to you and it is a very good quality machine I would not suggest any product below this machine and price point for your first machine as youll likely be very disappointed in the results  Eventually you may want to upgrade to a more robust multithousand dollar machine but this is great for the majority of consumers and is super user friendly Use higher quality beans directly from the roasters and learn how to use the machine and make drinks and youll be very happy with it The quality is truly amazing for such a low cost espresso machine  Side note Whole Latte Love on YouTube is a great resource for additional reviews tips and tricks and maintenance for this machine and many more Its also a great resource on how to pull shots steam milk pick types of milk and make many different types of drinks when youre

B00CH9QWOU,excellent espresso maker with few shortcomings,an awesome espresso machine for first time home baristas overall this machine is great but has just a couple of shortcomings which are easily mitigated first off it has a premium feel to it no flimsy plastic or cheap construction it feels solidly built i got the stainless version and it fits in perfectly with the rest of my stainless kitchen   As for the device itself pros large capacity water reservoir plenty of grind settings ill go over my setup after listing the proscons conical burr grinder fully auto with selecting the dosing amount or manual ability single and double wall portafilters for both 1 and 2 shot sizes double wall for pre ground espressoyuck 15 bar pump and a pressure gauge for letting you see where you are when it comes to seeing how you did on puck prep it has the ability for programming the shot duration so you can get the perfect 12 ratio 18g espresso into 36g of finished product in 25 seconds  this is what you are aiming for when dialing in your settings   Now for the cons which are few its not a double boiler system so you cant steam milk while you are pulling a shot its not the thermojet heater which has a 3 second heat up time seriously no biggie the steaming power is not that strong while it steams milk just fine its not super fast like if you go to a cafe and they steam it for all of 3 seconds and its done it will take about 6070 seconds to get it to microfoam and be at the right temp for this reason i steam milk immediately prior to pulling the shot so the espresso isnt sitting there waiting for the milk and cooling off the manual tamper that comes with the unit is pathetic they tell you how to use it but there ive found there is a steep learning curve with it as you have to have the right amount of grounds right tamping pressure applied AND you absolutely must have a level tamp otherwise you will get channeling and will pull an uneven and ultimately sour shot i think i did 4 correct shots out of 15 made that were enjoyable they were all drinkable but using the provided tamper only 4 of them tasted good and i would consider serving them to other people  as i said these problems are mitigated the milk frothing taking longer than could be boohoo deal with it honestly its really NO BIG DEAL take your time do it right and get that pro barista microfoam and do some latte art if you want i tried to do the art im not artist and suck at it so i gave up lol i find it stupid and would rather put my effort into making a great tasting drink which is about to go into my stomach and not an art museum as for being a single boiler system and not being able to pull a shot and steam milk at the same time no big deal as i said before i do the milk prior to making the espresso and thats it if you are making multiple drinks then it will just take a little bit longer which again is no big deal if you drink straight espresso or americanos or any non milk drink this is a moot point the puck prep is made easier by 1 weighing out 1819g of espresso putting that into the hopper dont fill the hopper all the way up because you expose the beans to air and oxidize them you want to store them in as much of a vaccuum as you possibly can 2 using 3rd party accessories prepare the puck CREMA BRAND dosing funnel and CREMA distributionpalm tamper tool which you have to calibrate once you evenly distribute the grounds to a flatlevel surface with the distributer side and then tamp it with the tamping side using your palm to push down on it once calibrated you get a perfect puck and a consistent shot every single time you can find youtube videos on how to calibrate the distibutiontamping tool these devices make espresso idiot proof right off the bat  my setup Illy classico whole bean grind setting 5 19g beans  19g ground  36g liquid in 26 seconds using single walled 2 shot PF steamed half and half Crema dosing funnel Crema distribution tool distributor set all the way at the base tamper calibrated as per youtube videos  overall this is a great machine that is easy to use once it is all dialed in which has to be done with any espresso maker btw and it pulls consistent great tasting shots each time as for taste start at the baseline and customize from there which is totally doable with this unit obviouslyt you can try different beans but you will need to dial it in again because beans have different strengths etc stuff not having to do with the machine get it i like it and it gets rave reviews,5,89 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2022",True
B00CH9QWOU,Replacement machine works like a dream paid for itself in less than 6 months,Update 9192020 The machine continues to may fantastic coffee  Enjoying some right now  One of our most used small appliances during the pandemic  Will never go back to SB again  It compares very poorly to what I can make at home now  Have run the descale cycle once because the light turned on but I think it is set to turn on at a certain number of cycles rather than based on actual scale build up since we use RO water and scale build up is minimal  In any case certainly does not hurt  Another tip Ive got is to get yourself some disposable earplugs and set them next to the machine  The decibels during steaming can be really high and they hurt my ears  I also keep a quick read thermometer on the machine to know when my steamed milk is at the temp I like  Update 6172020  This has ended up being one of my favorite birthday presents I gotten in years  Prior to owning the machine my family had a 100week Starbucks habit  Since purchasing this machine 4 months ago weve spent maybe 40 at SB  With COVID19 weve been at home and using this machine several times per day  The coffee it makes has only gotten better as weve learned to calibrate it  It has more than paid for itself in a few short months  It is well designed  We drink mostly Americanos so the hot water dispenser with automatic shut off is one of my favorite features  We were able to reprogram the machine to raise the water temperature very easily  The only glitches have come with the grinder which is a bit temperamental with certain beans but these have been minor  The coffee the machine produces is delicious with a good amount of crema  I run a cleaning table through the machine about once per month but because we have a reverse osmosis filter on our tap we have had no need to descale  I highly recommend using reverse osmosis filtered water in the machine to cut down on internal build up  The machine is fairly easy to clean and has a lot of nice touches like the little float indicator that tells you when you need to empty the drip tray  We also like the ability to calibrate shots  I am raising our review from 4 to 5 stars since it seems that our poor experience with the first machine we received was just luck of the draw and we really have no complaints with our current machine  It is wonderful Update  2182020  Amazon agreed to swap out the lemon see original review below for a new Breville Barista Express  It arrived today  I set it up and ran two cleaning tablets 3 cleaning cycles before I even tried to make my first cup of espresso  I let the machine warm completely and set the grind size at 5 as suggested  Pulled my first shot and the new machine performed perfectly with the pressure reaching and staying in the middle of the gray extracting zone as it should  The shot was smooth with beautiful crema  I took the opportunity to program this shot so that it would be exactly 1 oz using my little espresso cup  I then pulled a double shot and did the same thing programming the machine to fill two of my espresso cups  Again the pressure was perfect at the level 5 grind size setting and the coffee is absolutely delicious with a beautiful smooth crema  Apparently the first machine I received was a dud  Im glad Amazon allowed me to swap and will be sending the old one back tomorrow  Ive changed my rating from 1 to 4 stars If the new machine continues to perform as it did in its maiden voyage I will revisit the rating and perhaps raise it to 5 stars  I highly recommend that anyone who buys one of these start off with a couple of cleandescale cycles before trying to make coffee  Save yourself a headache and a lot of wasted coffee Pros  Very attractive and sturdy  The hot water dispenser is super convenient for making Americanos which is what I drink  I now dont have to heat up a separate kettle of hot water  Its great  The builtin grinder is really nice and its automatic function that also allows manual operation is convenient  The programmable temperature and shot amount adjustments are great Cons  Because it takes so much water to keep the machine clean and operating well it flushes itself after each use of steam or hot water the water receptacle has to be refilled OFTEN around every 34 coffees for me  I wish the machine had a bigger water tank  The drip tray also needs to be changed fairly often because the machine flushes itself but this is does not bother me as much and it is not as often as the water tank  The grinder amounts tend to fluctuate and Im still trying to figure out what adjustments or cleaning will might fix this  Im not impressed with their customer service  When I tried to get help for the first unit I purchased which ended up being defective it took a couple of days to get a response and then that was an email with the exact same information contained in the users manual I guess the assumption was that I had not read it along with a flat dismissal that there could be anything wrong with the machine  Thankfully Amazon dealt with the problem quickly by replacing the machine so I did not have to rely on Breville  I hope that I have a better response if I ever need to contact Breville in the future  Original review Ive wasted almost a pound of coffee over the past day trying to get the pressure on this machine to the espresso level that the instructions say is required  The machine will not go beyond the pre infusion level  I have cleaned it with the cleaning tablet as suggested in some of the reviews and I have adjusted the grind fineness and grind amount to every combination I can think of  Both settings are currently at the maximum levels  Ive tamped the coffee harder and also used less pressure  NOTHING works  Like I said I grew up with espresso as it is a daily drink in my culture  When I was little my mom made it a the little stovetop espresso pot  My last espresso maker was a 79 Mr Coffee that lasted almost 7 years and made very decent coffee with a nice crema everytime  No fuss  Then it finally broke and I cant find that model  I didnt want the new models with milk receptacles  Yuck  Anyway I thought well if Im going to spend over 200 on Mr Coffee why not just splurge and get the Breville  The coffee Ive so far gotten from this machine is thin and acidic and has almost no crema  As Ive said I have tried everything suggested  The pressure gage only reached the correct level on two shots after I had just cleaned it and then it went back to barely registering  IT SHOULD NOT BE THIS DIFFICULT TO MAKE A DECENT CUP OF COFFEE  Right now I feel like all these 5 star reviews are a product of the psychological phenomenon that happens with very expensive wine where people report it tastes better because they dont want to seem stupid for paying so much and not liking it  I will update if it turns out Im just missing the magic key to having this thing not be a ridiculously expensive pain in my coffee loving butt  But Im not feeling hopeful,5,119 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2020",True
B00CH9QWOU,BUY THIS MACHINE YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY,I rarely write online reviews of products I buy but I am so impressed by this machine I must share with people who are contemplating this purchase  BOTTOM LINE This is an extremely good value for the price and I would HIGHLY recommend this machine to anyone regardless of their experience level with making espressobased beverages  Read on for more detail  BACKGROUND I am very careful when buying products in this kind of price range and thus do a lot of research before buying  This is especially true with something you cant truly 34try before you buy34  I read over 100 of the reviews on this product and although there are some complaints the major theme is very positive  I have been using the Breville daily now for almost two months and feel I understand its pros and cons very well  As a coffee person my focus is on espresso Americano and lattes  I was never a dripcoffee person but I have been a hardcore Starbucks latte guy for 6 years  I have talked at length to baristas over the years to get a more technical understanding of what makes great coffee and previously owned a fully automatic machine from Saeco about a 600 machine  When it came time to buy a new machine I felt that I was ready to make the jump to a semiautomatic machine  Lastly I come from a technology background eg Apple employee and feel that I am a good judge of design manufacturing user interface etc  DESIGN This is an extremely well designed product  Every little detail from the exterior  interior packaging to the controls on the front of the machine is very thoughtfully done well executed and serves its intended purpose  From the beginning you see that it is a high quality product and Breville spent money where it matters  The materials are visually appealing as well as sturdily built with the kind of craftsmanship and heft you would expect from a much higher priced machine  Nice touches like having the tamper store in a magnetized hole in the top of the machine having the top surface of the machine stay warm from the boiler to keep your portafilter and coffee cup warm and creating a hidden accessories tray in the base of the machine are signs of top notch designers  Overall the product is relatively compact and will fit into any size kitchen situation  Lastly the user instructions are extremely well done and very helpful  READ THEM  PERFORMANCE The espresso produced is extremely consistent and only changes as your beans age although a pretty small difference  The water boiler heats up very quickly and you will be drawing a shot less than 2 minutes after hitting the power button part of this time is grinding the beans The controls are easy to use and the movable items such as the portafilter and steamer wand are holding up well and I have zero concern about long term reliability  The steamer wand compared to my previous Saeco seems to create much richer milk foam which is important for lattes and cappuccinos  There are a number of 34complaints34 from people on these reviews about how difficult it is to get good espresso but I can tell you my very first shot was good and has been ever since  I think these people are creating the wrong impression as this machine is incredibly easy to use  However its critically important that you read the instruction manuals FIRST to help ensure you get it right  The grind level is the only thing you really need to set and that will be personal preference to some extent but for my beans it seems best at 4  The other thing you control is how hard to tamp the grounds in the portafilter and I will tell you that if you give it a good strong press I use two hands on a hard flat surface it will be just fine  Dont overthink this machine  BEANS I strongly suggest you find a local shop that roasts their beans onsite so you can have truly fresh beans  You want espresso whole beans and they need to be 100 Arabic and NOT the 34oily34 kind  Otherwise you will gum up your grinder  CLEANING Terrific design makes this a breeze to clean  The water and grounds catch tray just lifts out in one piece and you can take everything to the sink without making a mess  A quick rinse and you are ready to put it back  One thing that cannot be avoided is that some of the coffee grinds will spill out of the portafilter during the grinding process and may even fall off the coffee maker and onto the counter or floor  I shake the portafilter mildly while its grinding to even out the grounds to minimize the mess but even that doesnt eliminate it completely  The other mess creator is tamping the grounds and levelling off the dose size this will cause grounds to be spilled  Up to you how to contain this although I just turn the dosing blade upside down and use it to scrape the grounds off my counter and into a bowl I use to catch the grounds when I level the dose Overall it is quite minor and requires less than 5 minutes of cleanup a day,5,174 people found

B00CH9QWOU,Maintenance and usability,As my profile name says this is my first ever review and a feedback for anything I bought anywhere online I felt like doing it because I have some spare time over Christmas and also I hope someone will find this helpful  If your primary criteria for choosing an espresso machine is the looks dont read further Choose this machine as my opinion it is the best looking machine on the market as of right now If on the other hand you are assessing other features keep reading  Bough this machine 3 weeks ago Was away for a week on work travels and used it effectively 25 times Made around 15 espressos and 10 cappuccinos in two weeks I owned two espresso machines in last 5 years and these were half the price of this one so you understand where my base line or the previous knowledge is  Issues  The first issue is around excess amount discharged of water in the bottom tray you will see it because Breville obviously even made a floater that flips red when it is about to overflow  Issue 1 Bottom tray was overflowing with water after using the machine 15 times I thought this was strange emptied the water and continue using the machine and this time I was monitoring the level of water in the bottom tray After 10 further drinks mostly espressos and a few cappuccinos the tray was halfway full I did not think this was right so I gave Breville support a call They were very responsive and called me back I explained the situation and the gentlemen I spoke with said it is a normal operating condition for this machine and that enduser is expected to empty the tray after a while due to as he stated 3 events taking place  Event 1 When you switch the machine on it automatically drains any stale water from its pipes into a tray so that a fresh water from the plastic container is used I see this as a positive and a smart function for the machine to do and can confirm not much water is discharged into a tray  Event 2 Machine drains a certain amount of water after every espresso made into a tray in order to get rid of any water in internal pipes so so no water under pressure is left in machine pipes as this prolongs the life of a machine I confirmed this whilst on a phone to him and there was not much water discharged in the tray  Event 3 Machine drains a certain amount of water after using steamer for eg milk frothing Again as explained this is so any excess pressure is released from the pipes as well as any water Here a large amount of water was released in the tray as I tested this whilst on the phone to support  My assessment of this issue is if you have the time to change empty the tray after roughly you made 15 drinks and stress about whether the water will overflow in you espresso tray then consider this a nonissue This normal operating condition is not listed in the manual or brought to consumers attention when choosing this product This is obviously known to Breville since they went as far as designing a smart flipping floater turning red when the tray is full However they do not consider this too much of a hinderance to users  The next issue number 2 again as per my conversation with the support is a normal operating condition Steamer pipe was blocked I had to use a cleaning needle supplied with the machine followed by switching on the steamer to get it to work This is after frothing the milk for around 10 cappuccinos I made using this machine last one yesterday The support said it may be because I used whole milk and I think I did Again this normal operating conditionbest practice is not listed in the manual or brought to consumers attention when choosing this product This is obviously known to Breville since they went as far as supplying a cleaning kit with this machine all with specifically designed needle Obviously they do not seem to consider this too much of a hinderance to users  Issue number 3 is to do with coffee grinder feature usability You cannot tell how much coffee has been ground the grinder will go on as long as you keep the porta filter baskethandle pressing the grinder switch As a result every coffee you make will taste different  Now in summary I am returning this product since I cannot afford the time to maintain it empty water clean Although making a coffee is a ritual I do not feel like I can get use to this machine It would require too much of my attention to maintain and learn how to operate it Also I want to be able to use any milk type without a fear it will clog the steamer pipe and lastly the coffee tastes differently every time I make it this last one would take some time to get use to the machine which admittedly I did not allow for Although I am a coffee lover I cannot justify the price of this espresso machine with having all the basic issues I listed And for whomever overengineered the selfcleaning functionality of this machine and the person who approved it they have done it to the detriment of usability and have affected the end product result at the end of the day  The next section are my suggestions on how to improve this product in the future so for Breville Product Owner in case they ever read this  1 Have a light at the top of the grinder dispenser so that I can see how much coffee has been ground Maybe have both options available to users unlimited coffee grinding needs light to see as well as the exact amount 2 Find a better way of cleaning the machine than discharging a lot of the water in the tray  this is a burden to enduser See suggestion 3 3 Instead of onoff steamer switch have a knob controlling how much steam to use This will help with cleaning the pipes as well as stopping excess water discharge in the tray since the user can simply release any excess steam with the knob Not as easy with onoff switch not to say impossible 4 Grinder dial numbers are hard to see  Hope this helps,1,305 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on

B00CH9QWOU,There was a learning curve but now that I got the hang of it I am able to make excellent much better than Starbucks lattes and,Update after a year  of usage 4 stars  The issue was resolved although it took more than a month for the whole process It turned out I needed to decalcify more often since I was not using the machine daily ie easier for calcium to harden Now I do it everytime I do the cleaning with the pill  Ive adjusted to the machine and now I figured how to make great coffee and keep it running However I am still the only one in the household that can produce a good cup My wife would rather drink instant coffee than try and learn all the quirks   Update  2 stars  After about 4 months there was no steam and the pressure for the espresso became 0 This was poor timing too as it happened during Christmas when I had my family over 5 stars for functionality and 0 stars for reliability Will post another update once I see how customer service resolves the issue   Original Review  5 stars  Ive had the Breville BES870XL for about 3 months now There was a learning curve but now that I got the hang of it I am able to make excellent much better than Starbucks lattes and decent espressos I thought I would the review mostly to give some tips to new users of the Barista Express in addition to the usual pros and cons  Pros  Coffee taste  this machine make great coffee and at the end of the day thats what you are buying this for right The coffee produced is much better than that produced with high end automatic machines Ive tested the Breville against an 800 DeLonghi unit using the same beans The DeLonghi automatic produced an ok espresso with no mess and quicker but the Breville produced a better tasting shot consistently  Looks  sure there are some plastic parts but overall the unit is very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing  Price  the unit is not cheap but its affordable and lets you make high quality espresso if you stop buying Starbucks and use this machine instead you will get your money back pretty quickly  Cons  Its tough to replicate the exact same conditions every time I will explain why and some people may get frustrated by that  There is a relatively steep learning curve for people like me who have not used a semipro machine like that  Compared to an automatic its time consuming to make coffee Making a latte for example easily takes 34 minutes of busy work Compare that to pressing a button and walking away  Now here are the tips and things to watch out that caught me off guard in the beginning  To get the pressure and coffee right you would need fresh beans Throwing in your year old beans will simply not work regardless of your grind settings quantity of ground coffee or tamping strength I settled on Lavazza Super Crema Espresso Its has decent taste not high end ok price and freshness lasts a bit longer due to the bean treatment  If you are a weekend coffee drinker like me invest in a container that is air tight where you can store the coffee beans If you just leave them the whole week in the coffee grinder they will dry up and the pressure when making the espresso will go down resulting in a watery mess  Make sure you are grinding enough coffee When tamped the coffee should be very close to the machine Once you get the quantity down only then start adjusting the grind size if there is too much space between the coffee grounds and the machine there is no way you can get good pressure  Invest some time in researching and learning barista techniques It will pay off Prepare yourself for initial frustration until you get the hang of it  Because freshness of beans matters you will rarely be able to get the exact same pressure as beans get more stale they soak water differently and pressure drops Accept that As long as the pressure is in the range you should be good  Forget about the programming option Because the pressure is not always the same it takes different amount of time to produce the same quantity of coffee say 30 ml Press and hold the button that way the coffee will jut keep pouring then press again when the desired quantity is reached to stop  Buy generic cleaning tablets They are the same as the branded ones only a fraction of the cost  Enjoy your coffee,4,22 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2016",True
B00CH9QWOU,READ my review and you will be GLAD you did  no really I put some time into this just for YOU,Despite some of the negative criticism sprinkled throughout this review keep in mind that 1 I am giving this machine 5 stars and now that I have spent a few weeks getting to know it intimately I love it  so much that if a burglar broke into my house and stole it I would order another one the same day  I have not been back to Starbucks since  All that being said you NEED to read this review so that your machine does not frustrate you and so that you get the most out of it  Read on my coffeeloving friend  1 I am a guy who knew nothing about espresso machines before this  I am very mechanically inclined and dont usually read instructions  This was different  this machine is NOT selfexplanatory and you NEED to read the instructions which are well written and even include a troubleshooting section  Dont get frustrated with this machine untilunless you have read all the instructions  2 This is not a standalone purchase  this machine costs around 500 give or take you need to invest another 100 right from the start preferably at the same time to get the most out of it enjoy it to the fullest and not get unreasonably frustrated by making your own lattes and mochas  3 The other things you REALLY should order at the same time and all are available on Amazon are   a 29 100pack disposable 20oz cups with lids and sleeves sold by Yesfresh  Trust me you want to get these  Its only 029 per cup and are far more convenient that trying to clean out a million dirty coffee cups from your caroffice each week  These are worth twice what they cost in the long run  And when your friends are over you need not loan them a nice coffee cup to go which you may never see again  just give them a paper cup to take with them   b 515 for 25 oz  2030 for 64 oz Torani syrups and sauces AND the pump tops that go with them always sold separately  IF you drink the same thing on a regular basis like I do such as a white chocolate peppermint mocha buy the 64 oz white chocolate sauce and not the smaller 25 oz bottle   c 14 Amazon Basics Cotton Washcloth  24 pack  grey the grey matches the espresso machine but the color doesnt matter  Again trust me you want a nicely folded stack of these sitting next to the machine  you will use 1 each time you make espresso and then it will be dirty and needs to be washed  At my house 3 people using the machine we bought two 24packs because we make so much coffee  two 24packs is not too many for our house Im thinking about buying a third pack   d 10 for pair of single shot size 15 for pair of double shot size Set of doublewalled espresso shot glasses  Do NOT buy the rounded ones ie Cutehom espresso coffee cups because they will not pour very well and drip all over the place down the side each time  very frustrating  Buy the JoyJolt Javaah Double Walled Espresso Glasses instead  youll be glad you did in the long run  And if youre planning to make mostly doubleshot lattesmochas buy a set of Dragon Glassware 6 oz Espresso Cups also doublewalled so that you dont have to keep fidgeting with the single shot cups to keep them in the right spot under the coffee dispenser  Its important to buy doublewalled glasses for two reasons  First it keeps the espresso hot while youre steaming your milk second it keeps you from burning your fingers when pouring the espresso into your coffee cup   e 15 Breville BCB100 BaristaStyle Coffee Knock Box  Again TRUST me you want this right next to your machine  the coffee grounds will start piling up quickly and you dont want your portafilter anywhere near a garbage can  This thing is a must  4 Space requirements This machine and all that you want to go with it will take some counter space  allow AT LEAST 34inches of counter width to accommodate  slightly more is even better  You will from my picture this is a 34inch setup and there is no room to spare  5 Making espresso  After you read the instructions here are some tips that they dont include to help avoid frustration   a When the beans are grinding lightly knock on the top of the hopper lid just like knocking on a door so that the beans keep feeding down to the grinder sometimes they get hung up  a light knock each time keeps this from happening  Do NOT overfill the portafilter after tamping or it will jam coffee grounds into the water outlet and could possibly damage the portafilter or locking guide  After the grounds are tamped down in the filter cup the silver part of the tamper should be just hidden beneath the rim of the portafilter the machine includes a tool you can use if you accidentally overfill the filter cup but after a short while youll figure out how much to grind each time and the tool will not be necessary   b You ALWAYS want to watch the pressure gauge when making espresso  It NEEDS to be in the dark grey area of the pressure gauge and ideally innear the middle of the grey area during the brew cycle otherwise you are not making good espresso  rather you are making either watered down espresso not enough pressure or not enough espresso which is too rich too much pressure  There are two key things that affect pressure the fineness at which the coffee is ground which is adjustable and the volume of grounds in the portafilter also adjustable  Although there is a one or two shot size setting I have found it best to do two 1shot grinds tamping down the grounds inbetween each singleshot grind  I have the grind volume setting on the 4th click setting and I have the grind fineness setting on either 2 or 3 play around and see what gives you the best results  IF the pressure is too low then either your coffee is ground too coarsely or your have not tamped it down tight enough or the filter is not filled with enough coffee grounds or a combination of anyall of these things  IF the pressure is too high then either your coffee is ground too finely or you have tamped down the grounds too hard tightly or a combination of the two   c IF using two singleshot espresso glasses to collect a doubleshot brew keep an eye on them during the brew cycle and make sure they are centered under the espresso being dispensed this can be avoided by using a doubleshot size collection cup   d IF making a mocha or other syrupsauce drink premix the espresso and syrup in the glass and stir thoroughly before adding the steamed milk   e Steaming milk is 12art and 12science seriously and it does not come naturally  If youve never worked at a coffee shop and been trained to steam milk do yourself a favor and watch a few good short YouTube videos on the proper way to steam milk  You will THANK yourself for taking 510 minutes on You Tube and learning the proper way to steam milk and things to avoid  Understanding the steaming process will allow you to control the amount of foam on top and not make big mess   f Before you steam your milk VENT the steam wand to remove the residual water from the boiler line you dont want a few teaspoons of water in your milk  Vent the line then turn the steam off  wait 5 full seconds  then insert the steam wand into the milk then turn the steam back on  Hold the handle with your left hand and place your right hand underneath the stainless steel milk steaming cup when the cup is too hot for your right hand to touch I mean really to hot to hold keep the steam wand in and start counting along with the pump which sounds like a metronome in the background  dit  dit  dit  dit   For a semihot lattemocha keep the steam wand in the milk for 30 doubledits dont start counting until after you can non longer touch the bottom with your right hand  34andone and two and three34 and so on until you get to 30 the equivalent of 60 single dits  For hot but still drinkable count to 40 doubledits and for veryhot 50 doubledits  Anything above 60 and you risk burning the milk which will ruin the flavor and you will need to toss it out and start over  When finished turn the steam off and remove the steam wand from the milk about 35 seconds before it finishes blowing steam to avoid having milk sucked back up into the steam line   g After you steam your milk VENT the steam wand again to remove any milk that inadvertently got sucked up into the steam wand line and prevent any from making its way into the boiler  IF milk makes its way back into the boiler unit because you failed to vent the line after use you will DESTROY the boiler permanently in that the milk cannot be cleaned out will burn during the next use and every cup of milk you steam in the future will have a burntmilk smellflavor  yuck  DO yourself a favor and vent the steam line religiously after each use  and make sure others who use your machine know that they can ruin it if they dont do so also there goes 500   h The bottom tray is easy to remove empty and clean comes apart in 3 pieces  You should empty this every 24 days of use because it fills up despite you not pouring liquid into it  reason is each time you finish using the steam wand or hot water dispenser the machine autovents out the line from the boiler into the bottom tray sneaky little devil  so even though you dont realize it its filling up a little with each use Fun fact  the hot water dispenser can be used for instant hot water to make tea  6 Cleaning up   a I unfold a clean washcloth each time I make espresso  When you tamp down the grounds it will help avoid damagingscratching your counter and will catch the spillover grounds there will always be some spillover   b When finished use hot water from your kitchen sink to rinse the espresso cups milk steaming cup portafilter and filter insert remove the filter cup from the portafilter each time you clean them then use another clean washcloth to set them out to dry upon   c The washcloth used to make espresso fold it in half twice into a square and use the hot water dispenser on the machine to get one corner of the square wet with hot boiling hot water then fold the square into a triangle so that the boiling water corner is exposed then fold that triangle into another triangle around the steam wand and thoroughly clean the steam wand  It will take a little time and firm pressure  make sure the wand is clean so that you dont get nasty milk residue build up on your steam wand  7 Keeping things stocked   a Milk If your family uses milk for other things cereal baking etc and up until now you have been a 1gallon at a time household its time to go up to a 2gallon at a time household  Trust me  once you and others in your house discover the delicious lattesmochas which are quick at hand the milk will begin to disappear quickly my house is now a 3gallon at a time household with 3 people regularly using the machine   b Keep a spare box of togo cupslids on hand when you open it order another one  it is not cost prohibitive and you never want to be out of togo cups in the morning   c Keep a spare bag of coffee beans on hand  also not cost prohibitive and if you run out of beans well theres no reason to ever run out of beans   d Keep a spare bottle of your favorite syrupssauces  If you run out all the fun is over  8 Quirks and tips   a Keep a close eye and refill often  like every morning the water tank in the back you need not pull it off each time just take a 4cup measuring cup and refill it when it gets 12way down  Reason being the machine is not smart like a Keurig  it has no sensor telling it when the water is out and it will run itself to its peril dry when the water runs out  this is not particularly good for the machine or the pumps   b Use top quality beans  I recommend buying 1 lb bags of Starbucks Espresso Roast beans  whole NEVER preground  WHY would you spend 600 on a coffee bar setup and then use crap beans or preground aka not fresh coffee  When you use top quality Starbucks beans I have no financial interest in Starbucks by the by  so if you prefer something else like Petes or Dutch Bros fine  but make sure youre buying whole bean bags of their Espresso Roast  24 doubleshot lattesmochas per day will go through a 1 lb bag of beans every 12 weeks   c Transitioning to decaf beans  Nope not easy nor was the machine set up for an easy transition  To transition from regular espresso beans to decaf beans you must unlock the bean hopper and remove it  then pour the regular beans into a ziplock bag then take your vacuum cleaner Im not joking and vacuum out the remaining regular beans from the grinding gear mechanism then replace the empty hopper  lock it in place then fill it with decaf beans  We did this once at my house  and will never do it again  I hope you enjoyed my review and it helps you make awesome lattes and mochas,5,"19,539 people

B00CH9QWOU,Fullfeatured high quality home machine but if I had to do over again,This is the first espresso machine Ive ever owned  I purchased it this Spring 2020 because like many of you I needed to stop going out  I didnt know much about home brewing espresso but I have lots of Breville products and I thought this would be a good entrylevel machine  I liked that it had all of the features I needed in a onestop solution but would still allow me to make real espresso not the stuff that shoots of a pod which I typically dislike  Armed with nothing more than the instructions it came with power water and beans I was able to brew espresso good enough to keep me from going into withdrawal but typically not delicious and appreciably less enjoyable than my favorite baristas in my favorite cafes  I also wasted a lot of beans in the process  After about 10 days of this bumbling around I decided to start researching how to get better performance learning a lot of coffee science along the way and over the next few months my technique and results improved but ultimately plateaued at a point where I felt my homebrewed espresso was now generally better than my favorite baristas  but still not consistent  one day I could make a perfect shot with all of the lovely sweetness and velvety texture of great espresso with little or no extraction defect but then the next day doing the exact same thing would get something uneven and over or under extracted and not as good  I was not exactly sure what the variable was but I suspected it was the grind consistency since by now I had become very practiced at everything else  The obvious issues with the grinder are that there is a limited range of adjustment and as you get to a good fineness for your beans there will be popcorning  the phenomenon of the beans bouncing off the burrs before passing through those popcorned beans will be ground more coarsely than the beans that were packed into the grinder by the weight of the beans sitting on top of them  Also while the machine has a hopper that encourages you store beans in it thats a terrible idea its better to store the beans in an airtight cannister or if they came from a nice roaster in their resealable airtight bags with oneway gas valves  I find that beans that are wellpacked like that do not have to be brewed within two weeks of roast as some coffee trainers say but rather can last up to 5 weeks from their roast date and still be very good with the peak time for brewing being 715 days after roast  Back to popcorning because the beans will grind differently based upon whether theyre at the bottom or top of the pile this would theoretically render every dose you grind prone to unevenness  This is not a defect of the Barista Express  This is just something in the nature of conical burr grinders  Some craft builders have figured out how to buildin flow control including the grinder that I now use which Ill come to that  But you can also be your own flowcontrol And thats how I hacked this to get slightly better consistency  I adjusted the grinder to be so fine that it would give me an espresso grind even feeding only one or two beans at a time and then did that  In so doing my grind was more consistent from top to bottom and my extraction improved significantly  But it was still not totally consistent And it makes grinding very labor intensive to feed beans one or two at a time  it makes it take 34x as long and you cant do anything else  The other thing too  and I learned this early in the adventure  is that you cant rely on the builtin dosing settings for the grinder  Just forget about these  Even if you dont want to go crazy and handfeed the machine like I do you need to get a scale  Measure your beans one shot at a time  The dosing volume controls on the machine are not volumetric they just control how long the grinder runs  Good espresso requires adherence to a brew recipe with a known mass of beans and that can only be done by weighing them  You could take your portafilter and weigh it after the machine dispensed your grind but this will invariably lead to waste  Now 8 months into my new hobby I treated myself to a new grinder  one youve definitely seen if you watch coffee videos on the internet all day  Now that I use this grinder instead of the builtin grinder I am not having any problems  In my last 30 shots 29 have been perfectlyextracted meaning no channeling no dead spots just nice even extraction at the correct pressure levels resulting in a shot that gets all of the sweetness out of the bean and little to no bitter or sour flavor and the 1 that wasnt was because I used the wrong grinder setting  Mea culpa  Oops  Thats the kind of consistency Im looking for  What does this tell me  The coffee brewing function of this machine is topnotch  The group head shower screen thermoblock all of it performs at a professional level and with the right grind you can make supremely good espresso on this machine and do anything you want with it  Drink it straight make a milkdrink make an Americano hot iced or whatever you want  Also the controls are very intuitive and the build quality is high as you would expect from Breville  As for maintenance espresso machines are high maintenance  They require regular cleaning and decaling  But Breville has made it a snap  It takes maybe 10 minutes to descale every other month with normal daily usage  A monthly cleaning cycle is so simple it practically runs itself  I also take off the shower screen and make sure it hasnt accumulated too much grit every few days  Thats not necessary  it can go weeks without cleaning and still work but I am a bit of a perfectionist as you may have gathered  Ive talked about brewing and grinding but not steaming  As for steaming it works fine  I know that there are commercial or prosumer models with slightly more sophisticated steam wands  Because this has a single thermoblock it is not able to brew and steam at once in fact the steam cycle takes quite a while to wind itself up So you have a Hobbsons choice steam first and wait for the temperature to come back down to where it is appropriate for brewing or brew first then steam while your shot goes cold  I dont make a lot of milk drinks and if you are its less important if the shot cools a little But it just makes the process slower  But once its running the steam wand textures milk very nicely  This isnt the most important feature for me because I drink mostly espresso or Americano rather than milk drinks  But if you drink mostly milk drinks then keep this in mind that there are machines with better wands and better ability to transition from brewing to steaming out there The steam knob on this machine also activates a hot water dispenser which is very helpful  It automatically cuts off after delivering the right amount of water to make an Americano two cycles will give me enough to brew a quick cup of tea when I dont want to wait to boil a kettle on the range That is a plus  However the steam control although it rotates is not a volumetric control its just an onoff you cant dial in more or less steam by opening and closing it more  So would I recommend this machine  I would say I recommend the Breville family more than I recommend this particular machine Because the espressobrewing is 5star but the grinder is only 2 or 3 star and I am so happy no longer need to use it  If I knew then what I know now I would not have gotten an allinone machine  I could have gotten a better grinder and a smaller lowercost Breville like The Infuser or a larger machine that focuses only on the brew and steam functions like the amazing Dual Boiler which might be my next machine  Before I knew better I liked the spacesaving and costeffectiveness of an allinone  But the allinone is not going to let you chase perfection in your espresso  So depending on what your wants needs budget and counter space requirements are you might want to look at other machines in the Breville line that have the same great controls fit and finish customer support that you would expect from Breville but that arent trying to be the jackofalltrades  If you do get this machine it has almost everything to get up and running except the water and beans but I do recommend some accessories 1  A 54mm bottomless portafilter so you can see your extraction in real time  this is KEY to learning about extraction defects 2  A drip scale  or any slimprofile kitchen scale that measure to 010s of a gram so you can accurately weigh your dosage of beans before grinding and also test your flow rate and mass of your finished product to ensure that you are getting a good ratio of input to output These are a MUST  Without seeing the extraction and without being able to measure your dosage you will not be able to make anything resembling tasty espresso from this machine Some other things are optional but helpful  A rubber tamp mat to protect your counter and limit the mess  A 54mm distributor tool to quickly and easily get a nice wellprepared puck  You can do this by hand but the tool makes it easier faster and less messy  The Breville distributor tool that it comes with is useless  A 54mm calibrated tamper so you know that your tamp application is consistent every time  The builtin tamper is adequate theres nothing wrong with it its  not useless but it doesnt give you any guidance for that allimportant consistency  Lots of replacement filters cleaning tablets and descaler This machine is not deficient because it doesnt have all of these things it actually does come with maintenace tools and starter packs of cleaning tablets and descaler which is really great  Its a very complete package Great instruction booklet and all of the nice packaging you would expect from a great company like Breville  In conclusion There are many people for whom this probably is the right machine  For me its not quite perfect because the grinding function is not as good as the brewing function and it was bringing down the quality of my results  In hindsight I should have gotten the Infuser or the Dual Boiler and a separate grinder  I only started to achieve really consistently great results when I was able to stop using the builtin grinder  But that does prove how good this machine is at brewing I dont think its possible to improve much on that,4,715 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2020",True

B0CB6B2JWG,Decent Vacuum with a fantastic feature,Ive been using this vacuum for about a month now and came in fully prepared to give it 4 stars its decent lightweight charges fast However it does ok on low pile rugs and absolutely terrible with thick pile rugs like bath mats battery life isnt great but its acceptable given the quick charge time basically a nice apartment vacuum assuming your apartment didnt have carpets  That is until today when I tried using one of the attachments its about 3 inches long angled and one inch wide the attachments channel lines up perfectly with the vacuum handle It is today that I realized that this attachment is perfect for vacuuming dust from quarter round and base board trim specifically on the 3rd strongest power setting As someone who is OCD about cleaning I absolutely despise cleaning baseboard however given that its painted white it is constantly showing dirtcat hairdog hair etc With this attachment I can do almost my entire houses baseboard in about 20 minutes in my 1500sq ft house and the attachment can fit on the very bottom end of the vacuum meaning I can clean them standing almost totally upright No more bending over and the associated back pain herniated lumbar sufferer here no more soapy rags I can just blitz through cleaning the baseboard as if it were nothing Given that the baseboard shows hair and dirt 1000 more than that hardwood floors if i need to do a quick sweep if I have surprise company coming over this is a fast way to make the house look good without a thorough vacuuming  This same attachment is terrific for picking up dust bunniesballs of pet hair that accumulate in random corners while doing the baseboard as well and is thin enough to fit between my fridge and cabinet under the edge of the stove where cabinets meet the floor and around my carpet runners on my stairs basically any weird spot that accumulates crap and is hard to vacuum While this vacuum is not perfect it is solid and to be honest with the knowledge of how it works with baseboard trim I would have likely bought it for that reason alone had I known given its light weight,5,132 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2024",True
B0CB6B2JWG,Best for Bare Floors,The Levoit Cordless Vacuum is a great budget friendly bare floor vacuum I got this to clean around the kitty litter boxes because the litter that I have tracks pretty badly and I am tired of walking on it and having to sweep I was wanting to find something that was equivalent in features to the Shark stick vacuum with a finned brush roll but not in price and I think I found it I have carpet tile laminate and hardwood floors in my house This little vacuum does not do very well on the carpet even very short pile rugs on the lowest suction setting It will do ok for the first pass or two and then the rug will either be rolled up into the brush roll or the carpet will somehow make the brush roll stop spinning So its a bit of a disappointment because I was wanting to clean my bare floors and my area rugs but can really only have a good job done on the bare floors The suction is excellent and can be adjusted It has two attachments one for drapes another combo one or corners and baseboards The battery holds a charge for several uses before it gets to a low charge I use this vacuum multiple times a week just for quick pick ups here and there and LOVE it Its easy to use and compact The only thing I wish it had was some sort of on board attachment mount Even if it was just for one attachment that would help me out a lot,5,35 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024",True
B0CB6B2JWG,Light and easy to use but has a small dustbin,I love how lightweight this vacuum is It isnt bulky so it is easy to store and easy to carry up and down the stairs  However because of its small nature the dustbin is pretty small I have to empty it multiple times while I am vacuuming the house  Its not as powerful as a full size corded vacuum But for a cordless vacuum it is very good And with that being said it always picks up a lot of dust and dirt from my carpets so I dont think I am sacrificing cleanliness for the smaller vacuum I like that it has three suction settings so you can choose how powerful you want it to be based on the mess you are cleaning up,5,22 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2024",True
B0CB6B2JWG,Far Surpasses Dyson,I just used this for the first time so obviously I cant speak to its longevity but as a former and pretty disgruntled owner of the Dyson V6 I can say that this IS a better mousetrap Many of this vacuums design features are superior to those of the Dyson including the charging setup the ease of emptying the dust receptacle the bristleless roller its ability to fit under narrow spaces the presence of a headlight     what else Oh it stands up on its own No more searching around for something to lean the vacuum against only to have it slide down and crash onto the floor cracking open the dust bin and undoing all the laborious vacuuming and revacuuming Id just done just sayin Dyson  I vacuumed the entire house including laminate floors area rugs lowpile carpet and a steer hide on the lowest setting and the suction was better than the Dyson It picked up long hair without it getting entangled in the roller It was decent at picking up pine needles And its relatively quiet in comparison While the Dyson whines like a blender on the fritz the Levoit purrs like a tiger  Finally nothing against Dysons contract with Disney but this vacuum is black and white rather than pink or purple I mean its not my major concern with a household appliance but I am surprisingly relieved to own a vacuum that comes in adult colors,5,8 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2024",True
B0CB6B2JWG,Better than Dyson,We loved our Dyson stick vacuum UNTIL the battery got to where it wouldnt last very long The battery continued to diminish its run time and eventually got to where it would only run about 3 minutes between charges The battery on the Dyson is changeable but its not designed to be easily changed In fact Im not even sure if Dyson even officially makes a replacement battery I ended up finding a third party replacement battery online and hoped that would fix our short run time It took some doing to figure out how to change the battery for the new one I bought The new battery helped extend run time a short while but the run time was still too short to finish one room Then the Dyson started to surge on and off Once again on YouTube to find out how and why it was doing this and how to fix it YouTube said clean a particular filter that is in the vacuum I did this and it worked for about 10 minutes then started surging on and off again and the battery would not last enough to finish one room We finally gave up on the Dyson and started looking for a different stick vacuum to replace the dying Dyson  That said I started an online search for stick vacuums and reviews of them  After my research I decided on this LEVOIT cordless stick vacuum We definitely wanted cordless battery operated We also wanted to be able to replace the battery easily if needed When ordering things online you just never know if what you bought will be any good Now that weve had our new LEVOIT and been able to use it a little while Im pleased to say we are happy with our purchase of this unit I honestly think it is everything I think the Dyson should have been  Assembling the vacuum out of the box is as easy as it comes Here are the things that I think most of you and we would like about this vacuum LIKES Easily replaceable battery Push a button to release the battery The battery also has a 3light charge indicator displaying level of battery charge The battery can be charged while attached or unattached to the vacuum If you want to store the vacuum where there is no electrical power for recharging you can detach the battery and charge it elsewhere In our case the fully charged battery lasts long enough for us to do at least three rooms We could barely get 12 a room done before the Dyson would conk out In fact the LEVOIT battery has lasted longer than we need it too We finish the 3 rooms and the LEVOIT still has plenty of charge to keep going As a note we have hardwood floors and the beater bar is gentle on our floor finish leaving no scratches Believe me we tested it out the first time on the floor to make sure it wouldnt damage the floor The vacuum will stand upright on its own unlike the Dyson The LEVOIT has three suction speeds to choose from As has been mentioned in previous reviews the three speeds do not have a light indicator to tell you what speed you are in but you can easily hear the difference in speeds as you depress the speed change button so I havent seen this as an inconvenience The amount of vacuumed up debrisdust is easy to see in the clear plastic debrisdust catch bin The catch bin is very easily detachable for emptying with the push of a button Unlike our old Dyson the LEVOIT beater bar head has an LED headlight This wasnt really a particular selling point for us until we got it and actually started using it Not sure if this would be an advantage if vacuuming carpeted floors but as I mentioned we bought this to do our hardwood floors Weve found the little LED light really illuminates the fine little stuff on the floor that we generally wouldnt see This helps us to ensure that we get all the little stuff sucked up It is just as maneuverable as our old DYSON The vacuum motor and debrisdust bin can be detached from the stick and beater bar head and the included attachments can be used to vacuum tight nooks and crannies We use this feature to vacuum our hardwood stair steps Much less expensive than the comparable DYSON DISLIKES Really none This LEVOIT corrects all the problems and dislikes we had on our old DYSON The LEVOIT is a little bit heavier than our old DYSON but only slightly and we really dont notice the difference in weight when using it,5,45 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2024",True
B0CB6B2JWG,Glad I didnt get a Dyson V11,I have a condo with tiled kitchen and bathrooms and low pile aged carpet elsewhere a setup perfect for a cordless vac  A few years ago I bought a Tineco cordless vac on a black Friday sale  Suction on the Tineco was OK but the biggest drawback is the premotor filter got dirty very quickly losing suction in the process  Tineco provides a filter cleaner accessory which is a good thing because you will use it often  I decided it was time to try another cordless vac on a black Friday sale which now start way before black Friday  My first inclination was to get a Dyson V11 get a good vac and get it over with but although its rated to be a powerful vac I was turned off by having to constantly squeeze the trigger and the nonremovable battery also I enjoy having LED lighting  So based on good user and online reviews I decided to try the Levoit model Im pleased with my Levoit air cleaner knowing I could return it  Boy Im glad I did  All the accolades you read are true  The suction is stronger then my Tineco and if the Dyson is stronger still I dont need it and dont feel the need to chew up my already aging carpet  The Levoit does a very good job usually in just the low setting or sometimes medium  I have filled the bin twice now and am happy to report debris is not sticking to the premotor filter  I really dont have anything negative to say  I guess the LED lights could be a bit brigher and more of a wide beam pattern but its workable as is  I havent used the accessory tools yet but they look pretty mundane  Like all cordless vacs I do wish there was a way to turn off the beater brush when attempting to vacuum my bath mat  Now I see reviews where sand is ground into deep pile carpet and the stronger Dysons can remove more then the Levoit  If this is your situation maybe the Dyson is for you or better yet I would stick to a corded vac but this is a prefect vacuum cleaner for someone in my situation an apartment or condo with a mixture of bare flooring and low pile carpet,5,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2024",True

B0B1VQ1ZQY,Its good enough at everything for people who want one device to do anything,Well for 190230 this tablet might not be the best at one particular thing but thanks to some commonsense decisions and Amazons resources and commitment its competent enough at everything all at once  Media consumption retro games word processing digital art battery life you name it  For media consumers it has an obscenely long battery life and a pretty nice screen Contrast is surprisingly good for an IPS display the black areas look black colors are very poppy and the 53 aspect ratio means youre not losing much space on either 169 or 43 content  For retro games lets talk about the processor It has a Mali G57 MC2 2 Cortex A78 cores and 6 Cortex A55 cores Anyone who keeps up with Android hardware will know this is a bizarre setup The Mali G57 MC2 and Cortex A55s are all modest cheap powersipping technology While the Cortex A78s are freakishly fast for this price point  But Im certain Amazon did this on purpose and its responsible for the great battery life which is essential for what is basically a media consumption tablet The modest GPU and high number of little cores keep battery drain minimal this is a 5w chip in a tablet where 710w chips are the norm while 2 A78s give it some serious oomph for the right sorts of tasks  This accidentally makes this little tablet a retro gaming powerhouse as that relies heavily on singlecore performance with the GPU and secondary cores being an afterthought  So its a tablet that just excels at anything where youll be using the screen a lot Reading movies old games etc It may struggle with native Android games due to the weaker GPU but compared to retro games there arent a lot of worthwhile Android games anyway IMO  The keyboard and stylus are also very well executed  Im typing this review on the keyboard case and the keys are a nice size thanks to the TKL form factor with short travel and a nice tactile springy feel The trackpad is small but accurate and doesnt lose my finger  The stylus itself uses a userreplaceable AAAA battery I like this decision because small Lipo batteries wear out fast and the AAAA means that the stylus has a super long life without worrying about whether youll be able to find a replacement in a few years The stylus is also magnetic and clips to the side of the tablet  The stylus is pretty accurate I dont notice much parallax or judder My Galaxy Tab S8 actually had slightly more parallax However there is more input lag than youll get with something like a Galaxy Tab S8 or iPad with Apple Pencil Its a quite noticeable amount of input lag compared to those two I will mention this tablet is about 13 the price of those devices and actually has a longer battery life So its still better than you expect for the price But will definitely be more of an entry level art tablet instead of something outstanding  All in all I still think youre getting a lot more for your money with this tablet than the others available Amazons reach with ereaders with keyboards with stylus peripherals with tablets and their resources and supply chain ie being able to order unusual tablet SoCs has definitely given the Kindle Fire 11 a wider spread of abilities and better quality than your ordinary budget tablet I cant really name anything Id expect to be better for the price  The only real flaw is software since Google Play is not preloaded and Amazon is not putting a lot of effort into their own App store be prepared to sideload some apps if you want to use the broader spectrum of abilities this tablet has,5,760 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2023",True

B0B1VQ1ZQY,Hands down the best Fire tablet since the HDX series,This is by far the best Fire Tablet since the HDX series and my favorite  To put into context my love of the Fire Tablet Ive owned or bought and returned the following over the past 11 years  Fire 7 201220142020 Fire HDX 7 2014 Fire HD 8 2018 Fire HD 8 20202022 Fire HD 10 2018 2019 Fire HD 10 2021 Fire Max 11 2023  Of those the ones I kept or kept the longest was the Fire HDX 7 the Fire 7 2014 and the Fire HD 10 2018  Specs for the Fire Max 11 can be found within the product description  Design and Build  The Max 11 boasts a sleek and modern design coupled with a build quality that feels robust and premium Its lightweight aluminum structure makes it convenient for both work and leisure allowing easy handling and portability I like that it went back to a similar sizeratio of the 2018 HD 10  Performance  Equipped with a more powerful processor than its predecessor the Max 11 is capable of handling various tasks smoothly Whether I am browsing the web watching videos or using multiple apps simultaneously the experience is fluid and lagfree especially compared to my HD 10  While not blazingly fast it IS much faster than I expected  Out of curiousity I wound up trying it with a bluetooth keyboardmouse combo and for the first timeI feel this is a possible viable laptop replacement for light to medium users  My HD 10 does not make a viable laptop replacement  Great multitasking ability can run enough apps at once with little to no lag  The speakers are merely adequate if not a tad disappointing  Thought normally I either use ear buds or a bluetooth speaker  I dont miss having a head phone jack and love having the quite responsive finger print sensor on the power button  Display  This has been probably my biggest surprise  The display is vibrant and crisp offering excellent viewing angles It renders colors accurately making it a joy to use for both media consumption and reading  I do wish it was a TAD brighter at times but the vibrancy of the colors makes up for it most of the time  Id wondered how much of a viewing difference going from the 10 to the 11 would be and its shockingly a pretty big difference  The Max 11 almost feels like a small tv or laptop screen at times  Battery Life  Battery life has been good  Its not the best nor the worst and should be more than adequate for most users  Since I have chargers adjacent to most places I use the tablet in my house Ive also not needed to run it low  Value  One of the reasons Ive had so many Fire tablets Ive owned only one other non Fire tablet a 6th gen iPad mini that I use for my business is that I love the value proposition and ease of use  Reviewers like to talk down the Fire software but I have never minded it  I am admittedly deep into the Amazon ecosystem with movies books music etc so the operating system has always made it easy to access and use that stuff  I have also side loaded the Play store I did this on my HD 10 also so I have access to almost the entire Play store of apps on my Max 11  If one is really ambitious you can essentially turn it into more an Android operating system  Personally I have never like the tablet OS offered from iPad or Android tablets  When the Fire Max 11 was first announced I was excited about the specs but hesitant on the price  So I waited until Prime Day to buy it also taking advantage of the trade in offer  In terms of what I paid 22930 trade in gift card46 trade in 25 off80 prime day offer7399 of course its an awesome value  At 229I would suggest either going refurbished if available or just waiting it out for the inevitable discounts at the time I write this its on sale for 18999  But I still think its a great tablet at 229 and wouldnt fault anyone that pays that  Overall In conclusion the Fire Max 11 strikes a balance between aesthetics and functionality offering a modern solution that should meet the needs of most while offering value and longevity It might be a worthy addition to your tech arsenal promising reliability and efficiency in daily use Rating 455,5,690 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2023",True
B0B1VQ1ZQY,WORST COMPUTING DEVICE I HAVE EVER OWNED  DO NOT BUY,BACKGROUND  I have worked in Information Systems for decades as a help desk analyst business analyst technical analyst developer project manager etc  I have owned varieties of desktops laptops peripherals smart phones iPhones etc  This Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet is absolutely the worst computing device I have ever owned  Its too late to return it so Im considering selling it for 50 just to get it out of the house  THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS ARE DOCUMENTED BY OTHER FIRE MAX USERS just Google it A Applications simply shut down for no reason without notice after five to ten minutes of use eg MS Word YouTube etc B Doesnt remember  settings from one startup to the next C  In many soft or hard device restarts the Fire Max 11 tells me the Sandisk SD Card I added for extra storage is not recognized and has to be reinserted  A reboot causes this tablet to forget the problem  The issue is not that I have to reinsert the Sandisk SD card  The issue is that the Fire Max inconsistently does or does not recognize the Sandisk SD card  Sandisk SD cards are highquality storage devices  I do not have this problem with Sandisk SD cards that I use in my Fujifilm cameras audio devices or other laptops D File Management utility has very poor functionality  Intuitive rightclick functionality is not available to move files around copypaste files  Cannot rename files E Downloadedinstalled Amazons Notepad utility which is a joke F  Silk Browser lacks important and useful functionality that can be found on ALL browser utilities for over twenty years eg bookmark management font size available settings or setting retention color choices etc G  Silk Browser offers ZERO options to adjust font size or Zoom the objects in the screenfeatures that ARE available in other browsers  The ONLY option provided by Silk is the PinchZoom which truncates all content on the right or left of the window in use  Compare this with any browser on a laptop computer where the  Zoom enables objects to be zoomedbut the content still remains INSIDE the physical screen of the laptop H  No good browsers are available to install on this Fire Max 11 tablet eg Chrome Edge Firefox etc  You are stuck with Silk as your only browser option I  Installed MS Word software functionality is incomplete when compared with modern word processing tools  But you cannot use the Wordperfect option that the Fire Max 11 repeatedly offers because of errors on attempting the install J  Just saving a Word document of simple text is a struggle  The ability to CTRLA highlight the text in the file to then set all the text to the same font type and sizeis NOT A FUNCTION THAT IS AVAILABLE K Almost ZERO thirdparty software utilities exist to download and install on this tablet  Compare this with other brands of tablets where good thirdparty software is available L  Weird error messages popup in almost every session about some already installed utility being too new or too old for the version of Android on the device  What is causing all these weird random out of context error messages M In conclusion I wasted 200 on this Amazon Fire Max 11 piece of junk I will sell it for 50 just so I can stop looking at it  Do not make my mistake  Go check out Google or Microsoft or Apple tablets  I love Amazon but Amazon needs to leave tablet manufacturing to companies that have a history of tablet manufacturing  UPDATE  AFTER ANOTHER MONTH OF USE A Application shutdowns have become more frequent eg YouTube just shutting off B  Application lockups have now started  Previously YouTube app would just shut off  Now it locks up while a video is playing  No mouse clicks or keyboard clicks can get the screen to respond  Only solution is the to do a hard reboot by presshold the physical power button C  After YouTube lockup and hard reboot YouTube then FAILS to restart  Clicking the YouTube icon activates YouTube as usual and begins the increasing percentage display that occurs with each start up  However when activating YouTube after a hard reboot the percentage display never goes beyond 10  Instead I am required to do a soft reboot or hard reboot of the device to get YouTube to start working again CONCLUSION  I consider this device to be pretty much unusable  I purchased this device to check news during the workday so that I would not use my employer laptop for personal stuff SELL THE FIRE MAX  I previously thought of selling this device  But I now feel it would be unethical of me to sell a device to someone knowing that the device is defective  I will keep the device in hopes that I can use it as just a poorly functioning Kindle book reader,1,491 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2024",True
B0B1VQ1ZQY,A very efficient and low cost tablet,Having used the Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet for the past six months I can confidently say that it offers a solid performance for its price range The 11inch display is a standout feature boasting a crisp 2000 x 1200 resolution This provides clear and vibrant visuals making it a pleasure to watch movies browse photos or read ebooks The screens brightness and color accuracy are impressive even in direct sunlight which is ideal for outdoor use The overall build quality of the tablet is robust with a sleek aluminum body that feels premium and durable in hand making it both aesthetically pleasing and sturdy for daily use  In terms of performance the Fire Max 11 is powered by an octacore processor and 4GB of RAM which delivers smooth and responsive app performance Navigating through the interface is generally fluid and most apps load quickly without significant lag This makes it suitable for a variety of tasks from streaming HD video content to playing casual games The battery life is another strong point offering up to 12 hours of mixeduse on a single charge ensuring that the tablet can easily last through a day of moderate to heavy use without needing a recharge  However there are some limitations to consider While the tablet handles most apps well it struggles with more demanding applications and highend games There can be occasional slowdowns or stuttering when multitasking with several resourceintensive apps open at the same time Additionally the Amazon Fire OS while userfriendly is heavily integrated with Amazon services which can feel restrictive for users who prefer a more traditional Android experience or access to the Google Play Store Some popular apps may not be available or may require sideloading which could be a hassle for less techsavvy users  Another area where the Fire Max 11 falls short is in its camera quality The front and rear cameras are adequate for basic video calls and casual snapshots but do not deliver the highquality images or video that more premium tablets offer The lack of a fingerprint sensor or facial recognition for unlocking the device also feels like a missed opportunity as these features have become standard in many modern tablets This means relying on traditional PIN or password methods which might be less convenient for some users Additionally while the tablets build is generally solid it is slightly heavier than some competitors which could be a drawback for prolonged onehanded use  In conclusion the Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet offers good value with its excellent display solid build quality and decent performance for everyday tasks However its limitations in handling more demanding applications restricted app ecosystem and mediocre camera quality might be points of consideration for potential buyers,5,69 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2024",True
B0B1VQ1ZQY,Great as a Kindle ereader but very limited functionality as a tablet Alexa no longer works,Ive had the Fire Tablet Max for several months now Initially I really loved it I wanted an ebook reader with a large enough screen to read my Kindle books plus I wanted the functionality of having a Personal Assistant Plus I wanted something I could go online with At first the Fire Max 11 provided well 25 of the 3 As an ebook reader its great With the larger screen I can easily read books from my Kindle library so Im very happy with that  I can go online BUT the Fire Max 11 like all Amazon tablets uses only Amazon Silk browser and only apps from the Amazon App Store Many apps I would  like to use are not available like Dropbox Adobe Acrobat to read pdfs Internet security and many othes And while it has Bluetooth Ive thus far not been able to pair my laptop with my Fire tablet My computer will pair and connect but the Fire Max Tablet will NOT even when the numbers match on my computer and tablet So theres no way to share files except with the USB I havent tried that yet so cant speak to whether it works or not However because most of the files I want to view on the Fire Max 11 tablet are pdf files theres no way to read them without a PDF viewer So thats a downside as well as the limited apps from the Amazon app store Also theres no way to add an antivirus or firewall or adblockers either So going online is extremely limited without the security one would like to have  Finally Amazon Alexa Initially she was a godsend I  could be reading an article on the NY Times or Washington Post app both of which are available in the app store ask Alexa a definition of a word and she would give it all while my Fire Max 11 stayed on the article screen which provided a streamless reading experience Since I could choose to have Alexa respond even when the device is locked I could wake up in the morning and ask her the time the tempweather and she would respond immediately I  could set reminders and alarms and she would give me my reminders even when I wasnt using the  Fire Max 11 tablet and the screen was locked The same with alarms So if you wanted to set an alarm for each morning that worked quite well The only issue I had  was that for some unfathomable reason Amazon designed the cover for the Fire Max 11 to actually cover the speakers so that the sound is greatly reduced and sometimes hard to hear or even miss The cover should open and close on opposite sides to work well with the speakers  However since Alexas latest update a few days ago all that functionality is gone Frankly Id fire the tech team that came up  with this update Ive come to the conclusion that Amazon intends to phase out having Alexa function as a personal assistant on the Amazon Fire tablets much as Microsoft Windows phased out Cortana from functioning as a personal assistant in Windows a big mistake imo  The first thing I noticed after the update is that  when I spoke Alexas name a textbox much like the one youd see on your phone if sending a text or using Messenger to send a message pops up So if  Im reading an article now on the Washington Post NYTimes etc and ask Alexa for a word definition or who a person mentioned in the article is the screen reverts to Alexas text screen immediately Their customer care team says thats so we can see what we say and how Alexa responds  which I think is idiotic However since the screen  leaves the news app in order to get back to the article I was reading I have to close out Alexas new  text screen go back to the home screen on the tablet select the news app again and go back to the article I was reading WAY TOO MUCH hassle does NOT make for a seamless reading experience and frankly its  just as fast to use  an oldfashioned dictionary So that functionality  is  lost  Perhaps more importantly Alexa no longer works when the device is locked I dont know about you but I dont use my tablet 247 There are times during the day when the screen is inactive or when the cover is closed  Since I want to protect the screen on my tablet from spills accidental falls or something falling on it and prevent cracking or breaking or getting liquid from say coffee or water on it I close it when not in use Closing it automatically locks the device Not sure if it used to in the beginning because Alexa would still work back then even with the cover closed but it does now Also the device automatically locks after a period of time  which I can set at certain increments between 5 min and 30 minutes There is no option not to lock the device at all after a period of inactivity And why would I not want to have that security First of all to keep the Fire Tablet Max always active would take up  alot of battery power That means Id have to keep it plugged in all the time or  be constantly recharging it which wears down the battery And the purpose of a tablet is  to have a mobile device so keeping it plugged it makes it more difficult to use especially because the charging cord is less than 3 ft long Id say more like 24 28 inches So thats not really feasible And again probably not good for the battery  However since Alexa no longer responds from the lockscreen its not just that she doesnt respond to questions but the reminders and alarms no longer work now either unless the device is active and Im using it That rather defeats the purpose since if I set an alarm to wake me up Im sleeping and so not using my Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet  meaning its locked and the alarm wont work If I set a reminder for a birthday to take out the garbage a doctors appt or whatever I will no longer get that reminder unless I am actively using the tablet That too defeats the purpose of a reminder because I have to remind myself with some other device to make sure Im using the Fire Max 11 tablet at the time the reminder or alarm is scheduled so I can get it And if I have to set a clock alarm and paste a sticky note on it why I set it like so that I can unlock my tablet so Alexa can remind me to take a pill or that its someones birthday etc then I already have the reminder on a sticky note and an alarm clock that goes off so that Ill read the sticky note No need for Alexa But also no functional Personal Assistant either  So again Alexa on the Fire Tablet Max 11 and Im guessing all tablets has been essentially  neutered in her functionality as a Personal Assistant So Im guessing although customer care denies it that shes being phased out on the tablets which I cant understand Frankly this update looks more like it should have been only for a phone and not for a tablet When I go to the help section now for example it gives specific instructions for help with Alexa on mobile phones or on Echo devices BUT NOT TABLETS Its as though the update was meant for a different device but all devices got it And theres no way to undo it  Heres some of the literally  stupid responses Ive gotten from customer care 1 To not see the text box pop up when I say the woke word aka Alexa theyve told me to disable handsfree Alexa Well that means the only way I can use Alexa to ask a question give a command etcwait for itIS TO USE THE TEXT BOX AND MESSAGE HER So how does that solution even made a modicum of sense IT DOESNT If I dont want to see the text box or use the text box why would I make it so thats ALL I see and can use Not sure who thought that one up but its literally laughable its so idiotic  A second solution Ive been told is to do a factory reset and then Alexa will be in its original state  maybe I shouldnt have to tell an Amazon tech specialist why that solution wont work but I bet most of the people reading this  can guess Yep once you do a factory reset you not only wipe out all your data and have to setup the device all over again BUT all those apps that are installed including Alexa will begin to update Alexa comes embedded in the Amazon Fire Max 11 software so it updates automatically In a matter of hours or even days youll have to do the reset all over again Great way to literally ruin your tablet Or maybe Amazons plan to have you keep replacing them Fool me once and all that Thered be no second purchase  Oh and as I mentioned Amazon Alexa is embedded in the Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet software much like Cortana used to be embedded in Windows and is now embedded in Microsoft Office 365 and only works with office applications Theres no way to uninstall her and reinstall her  Or even just uninstall her I suppose I could just disable her Im not sure But again she cant function as a Personal Assistant if shes disabled  Oh and heres the  final bright solution one tech gave me Tell Alexa to exit Show Mode I tried several times to tell her that my tablet isnt IN show mode so how can Alexa exit from something that isnt enabled She kept insisting though so I unlocked my device and told Alexa to Exit Show Mode Alexas response Sorry I cant help with that The agent asked me to do it again rotflmao So I did Alexa exit Show Mode Alexa Sorry  I cant help with that  Alexa is officially dead as a Personal Assistant on the Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet Im guessing this is true of all the tablets but I cant speak to that I just know that functionality is gone on my Fire Max 11 tablet Ive called and complained and told them all of what Ive said here but to no avail Theres no way for me to roll back the update to the previous version Again my guess is that this update was more intended for Alexa apps on mobile PHONES but so far Ive not gotten an answer on that But just looking at the new Help section all the solutions or issues listed now  are specifically for mobile phones whereas previously that was not the case  So while I would have initially given the Fire Max 11 tablet 4 stars without Alexa Im downgrading it to 1 star In my opinion buy a real tablet if you want a Personal Assistant Just dont buy one that has Alexa Buy one with either Siri or Google Assistant While one customer service agent tried to tell me theyre no good I know people who have ipads and other Android tablets who use the Personal Assistant all the time with no problem  Why  Amazon would remove itself from this market ie having a tablet with a functioning Personal Assistant is beyond my comprehension but that is what they did So therefore no longer worth the money  And this is just the tip of the iceberg Apps that are suspicious and full of ads abound in the Amazon App store but functional apps like antivirus and security software are nowhere to be found You cant even find a  Starbucks app  So as a tablet I could not recommend this Whatever potential or functionality this glorified Kindle reader had is now just that  a Kindle ebook reader Shame on Amazon This tablet had real potential to compete with some of the other tablets on the market but instead Amazon shows its shortsightedness by taking away even the limited functionality it had in this last update  And  dont even get me going on its customer care Clearly that has been outsourced to a planet or country where solutions are not part of the package and representatives barely speaking intelligible English read from lame scripts that are laughable as in the examples I have already given  After using this tablet  for several months now Ive had to downgrade my review down to a 1 star All thats left on it really is the Kindle app Its great for reading books but thats all Of course Amazon could in their infinite lack of imagination and competence decide to take that away too at some point As a Kindle ereader I could offer some suggestions here too  All in all this device does not qualify as a true tablet The name is misleading and Amazon should really downgrade the description to be fair to consumers,1,116 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024",True
B0B1VQ1ZQY,Great productivity device,UPDATE Ive been using this Fire for about a year got it on Prime Day 2023 and I still like it a lot It is a bit heavy for relaxed reading so I also got the Fire 10 HD 13th gen this year 2024 Prime Day Indeed the 10 is significantly lighter even thought the size difference between the two is fairly small same width but 11 is taller when in portrait so it is wider screen in landscape It is nice to have both I will keep using the 11 with the keyboard it came bundled with and I will not get a keyboard for the 10 The keyboard is awesome and having the 11 be wider than the 10 allows the keyboard to be very comfortable So if you touchtype and want the attached keyboard I recommend the 11 over the 10 Ive used the keyboard extensively and it really is great other than accidentally touching the touch pad occasionally and unintentionally change my typing location  Also I noticed that the 10 is annoyingly slower than the 11 when rendering all the icons on my home screen Occasionally the icons disappear and you have to wait for them to reappear It is only a couple of seconds but I dont recall ever seeing that on a regular android device so it is a Fire OS issue that is more apparent with the slower 10 But the main reason I decided to write an update is the SD card issue that some other reviewers mentioned  I thought others had issues because they set up the card as internal which is essentially but not quite like having a bigger internal space for everything including apps This is dangerous and there is a reason why you can no longer do this with newer versions of Android So unless you have a zillion apps and really need bigger internal space because of your apps you really should set up the card as Portable Memory instead no apps on the card only media and other files etc Then you can decide what types of files to put there AND you can safely remove the card and access it on another device like your laptop thats why it is called portable You can choose to have the Kindle app Prime Movies etc download to the card Most people need expanded memory for media so this makes sense and again it is safer You also have good control over what gets stored on an SD card vs internal storage  But setting up the card as Internal isnt the reason people had issues because today for the first time I had the issue that others complained about which is that my card supposedly unmounted and the Fire asked me to reformat This would be a bigger problem if I had set it up as Internal rather than Portable I shut down the Fire removed the card and mounted it in Windows Windows told me there was a problem with the card and I should scan and fix it I did Windows showed it as then fine no further issues And I had no trouble copying out all the folders from the card to Windows Returning the card to the Fire still showed the screen for formatting the card but Im wondering if this is because the Fire tends to show screens that were on when you shut down Or else the card was somehow marked as needing a format The super weird thing is when I said to format as Portable Memory it did so without removing anything Doesnt formatting a card mean erasing it or showing it as blank so you start over with it fresh   I was going to format it however Fire likes to format and then return the original folders But I did not need to copy back anything It is working fine now So apparently it would have reformatted only if I had decided to swap from using it as portable to internal Probably every time you unmount eject the card you will get this message and it wont really erase everything and reformat unless you opt to change how you want to use the card So all is okay with the card but this situation should not have happened It probably happened because some function was writing to the card and another function an update dismounted it thus interrupting the write This is why Windows had to fix it  So I think the card issue almost certainly has nothing to do with the particular card so others comments are correct about that Ive been using a new highquality Samsung Pro Plus card overkill for a Fire tablet but it was on sale When the card issue surfaced I was trying to do some updates from the Appstore and it seemed frozen There is still a problem with the Appstore So the Fire was not in a good state It may be a good idea to reboot it occasionally once in a while I probably hadnt rebooted for about a month I was also thinking maybe it was trying to update and that broke its normal functionality Could be My biggest suspicion It is on Fire OS 8324 from July 3 2024 I checked for updates even though it showed as last checking today and it said to tap to install an update but when I did everything froze  I eventually went back to the updater and now it said I have 1 update rather than a bunch of gibberish that suggested some pieces were still downloading and with a broken button for installing as initially happened Now I was able to install the update and when I rechecked for updates it showed no updates found and the Check Now button reappeared as normal So all seems fine Other than the fact that my OS still shows as 8324 And it still shows it as being from July 3  today is Aug 7 And I did not get the usual message that my system has updated It was a secret undocumented thing or the old update reinstalled why Perhaps it was not a Fire OS update but an update of some other builtin component like the Apstore or some such thing The Appstore still seems hung on the page where I update apps The other parts of it work It is an issue with the app because FDroid can install and update just fine And my new Fire 10 also works fine so it is not the server for the Appstore Im now thinking it got a corrupted interrupted update and wont work until Amazon has a newer update that I can install on top of it  Amazon if you are listening please please be normal about updates Let your users know there is an update and let them pick when to do the update If controlfreak Apple can do this you can too I do not want to be using my device while it is trying to update or shutting it down to remove a corrupted card Thats just asking for trouble I want to have it plugged in and keep my hands off it for a while This is a problem with other Amazon devices as well Okay youre gonna force an update whether I like it or not but please if you dont want to cause a lot of grief just let people have some control and awareness when the device needs to be updated My guess is that even when there is only a minor update as seems to have been the case for me the Kindle is not fully functional but pretends to be and since it is not fully functional it quits some processes some unexpected quits will cause corruptionscrashesSD card issues  But otherwise it is a good device Truly Im still happy to have it I love the whale background   Initial Review I got the productivity bundle and I am super pleased I needed something to take notes with in classes that also had a touch screen for drawing and this is great for that Amazon Appstore has OneNote and Squid and both are great for notes with this In my experience it DOES matter which app you use with the pen because a paint app I tried worked but was slow so I blame the app since OneNote and Squid are fine There is also a fairly new open source app called Saber that seems great I still need to experiment with that one  available on FDroid Im thinking that some of the professional reviews on other web sites got an early or different version of the pen because the harsh criticisms of it do not match my experience It works great  This is my 2nd Fire tablet and I like it so much better than my first one Fire 8 HD from 2017 I wasnt unhappy with the old tablet when I got it because I got it on sale for a great price but I just almost never used it because the screen was so unpleasant and stressful to look at plus the device was annoyingly slow Not so with this new tablet  I am very pleased with the screen quality and the speed is good for how Im using it  The pen and keyboard are truly awesome I wasnt sure at first whether I liked the aspect ratioshape of the tablet but actually it makes sense The longer shape allows for nearly fullsized key spacing on the keyboard while not causing the tablet to be unnecessarily large and heavy as it would be with the iPads aspect ratio Someone said they prefer the snapin clamshell keyboard that is available for the 10 but I much prefer this thinandlight keyboard didnt have the 10 but considered it and looked at pics of its keyboard It is super easy and fast to pull off and snap on the keyboard and it does not need batteries At home where I have real laptops I use the tablet mostly without the keyboard and half of the keyboard case stays on it protecting the back and the camera and giving the tablet a nice nonslip feel plus I can use the foldout stand I dont use it on my lap at school and at home I use a lap desk so I dont mind that I cant put it directly in my lap while typing Really I have no complaints at all about this setup Perfect  Well maybe I can complain a little about Fire OS but it is mostly okay I would hate it for a phone but it is fine for a tablet And it is much improved over what I had on my old Fire especially the settings I like to have control and info I put Google Play on my previous Fire but Im not sure I will do so on this one I mean I have an Android phone that has things Id like from the Play store like my calculator collection and bank apps and whatnot I dont need to replicate that on this tablet Ive installed FDroid so I can still easily put a bunch of nice apps on it I have a Linux terminal app Termux and will probably install a small Linux distro with desktop which will further expand the usability Plus I have a Microsoft 360 subscription from work and it is nice to have an app for that on this tablet too It has the most critical work apps like Zoom and Teams and Office and Outlook So it already has what I really need on a tablet Oh and Kindle of course I think in the past it was almost necessary to sideload Google Play but the Amazon Appstore now has my most critical apps at least for a tablet Yea it generally is not great and not well maintained with tons of outdated apps Dont be mad at Amazon about Google Play Store YouTube etc It is a Google policy Google does not want others to take the open source piece of Android and build their own thing on top of it with no control from Google There are penalties for doing that And Amazon couldnt sell its media to you directly on regular Android so it kind of has to make a separate OS This is your tradeoff for getting a subsidized tablet Im poor so I will accept the tradeoff especially for a tablet as nice as this one  I paid to get rid of the ads and I do that on every Kindle or Fire I value discounts a lot but aesthetics even more and now this tablet

B0BL5SZ3VV,Great tablet horrible worry free guarantee,Ive order two sets of three tablets for my three kids over the years The first older set of kid fire tablets I bought ended up having to replace one twice due to a cracked screen from a rough kid There is not a easy way to start the process you have to go through the chat or phone service to get it done It got done with no issues They sent me a refurbished replacement and then I mailed out the damaged one within a certain time to avoid being charged No time without a tablet Well the second set I had to replace one due to screen tearing and artifacts appearing on the screen I contacted amazon chat and after going in circles they had no idea what I was talking about I got passed off to another person and they offered to replace it even though it was past the standard warranty and acted like they were doing me a favor I copy and pasted the 2 year worry free guarantee policy and sent it to them and still nothing Then I talked with another person who finally agreed that it was part of the kids worry free guarantee Now there is a new process you have to mail the old tablet in first and then if they find something wrong with it they will send you a replacement after a week or so That means the kid will be without a table for all the shipping time and processing time I asked was there an option like done in the past and they said there is an expedited option but I would have to pay a fee That seemed like a scam as none of that is described in the worry free replacement guarantee So while the tablets are nice the service to get it repaired is not good,4,30 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2024",True

B0BL5SZ3VV,Educational if you are picky and turn off WiFi,Quick tip for little kids set it up and download your favorite apps then turn off WiFi This prevents them from accessing and downloading tons of new games which will lead to a full hard drive and reduced attention spans With this workaround its very easy to pick and choose educational content with limited access  Full review I got this tablet for a good price and wanted to customize it for my 4 year old to take to grandparents house I have plenty of of experience with tablets for the older siblings so I know how easy it is to get addicted to garbage apps and low quality entertainment  During setup I was very worried with the unlimited kids content even when I set the age range to 23 years there are A LOT of videos and apps that I would like to restrict  You think it would be easy but its not It seems you have to go and block each appbookvideo individually there are thousands I also found a way to press and hold the account and block apps in bulk you can search for a keyword and block all but this is not ideal  Then I remembered the pro tip I read during my research Just because you see apps and videos in the library doesnt mean they all have to be used Simply click to download the ones you want and then turn WiFi off Note I found the next day wifi connected automatically so I removed it completely and did airplane mode too Youll need WiFi to setup the tablet but then youre safe to remove it  I plan on enjoying these apps as I set it up and then once every few months I can remove and add new apps manually This might seem tedious but its totally fine to get a nice variety of apps and my kid is thrilled by it  The only problem I see is that I cant do screen time  timed access  share my purchased movies as those require wifi but it has been working for us because I only loaded 20 apps and Dr Suess content which I would gladly allow him to play  This is way better than my previous attempts to give my kids a tablet iPad because Amazon Kids gives you so many adfree games that are amazing Toca Boca Educational apps etc I paid a lot to buy these apps on iPad but this Fire tablet experience is much better as its designed for kids and the interface is locked down for kids  I set it to the kids account put a nice long password for parents dashboard and a pin for kids account  Size 10 screen is great So far so good with some tweaks for kid friendly access,4,4 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2024",True

B0BFC7WQ6R,Alarm Doesnt Work  Fixed now,I set the alarm for 630 AM and before it goes off it automatically sets itself into snooze and adds 9 minutes to my set time When it gets closer to its own set time of 639 it happens again and adds another 9 minutes to the alarm time This happens continuously for a hour and 20 minutes so an alarm I set for 630 AM goes off at 750 AM This is unacceptable A alarm clock that you cant depend on is worthless  I called Amazon tech services and they had me reset the Spot back to factory settings and set it up again Then we tested it by setting alarm for 2 minutes ahead and it worked so we thought it was fixed So the next day I set the alarm for 630 AM weekdays and this morning it went off at 750 AM Junk  Ive checked everything in the Alexa app and have tried setting the 630 AM alarm up using the app as well setting by voice It doesnt matter the 630 AM alarm goes off at 750 AM  I give up and returning this worthless alarm clock  Update Amazon Outreach Department contacted me about the problems we were having with the Echo Spot alarm It seems some other people were having the same problem We run fans at night and the Echo Spot tap feature was on They asked me to turn off the tap feature in the Alexa app We did and now the alarm has worked perfectly ever since  They said there seems to be a correlation between fans running and the tap feature on causing the Spot to reset the set alarm time into snooze mode automatically  We have a 2nd Echo Spot which wasnt set up for an alarm so I tested it On Monday I set its alarm for 730 AM with the tap feature on and the bedroom fans on Sure enough the alarm failed and it set itself on snooze mode for over 30 minutes So on Tuesday I set the alarm for 730 AM with the tap feature off and the fans running It worked perfectly and went off at exactly 730 AM and no snooze problems Problems solved   I dont care if the tap feature is off in the Alexa app just tell it to snooze by voice and it works perfectly and only snoozes for 9 minutes  I have reported my findings to Amazon as they are working to figure out why this is happening There seems to be a correlation between the tap feature on and fans running in the room  Anyway the Spot alarm works perfectly now on both Spots and we love the Echo Spot now and everything it does  I want to thank Amazon for actually caring and reaching out to me and working together to fix this alarm problem I was going to return them but now they work perfectly and we really like this device so Im canceling the return,5,15 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2024",True

B09BDG5RP3,Very pleased,I bought the electric lunch box on an impulse because it was on sale and in one of my favorite colors  After ohsomany years of bringing a sandwich and piece of fruit to work for lunch it is delightful to have a hot homemade meal instead  The food container holds slightly more than a can of Progresso soup which is plenty  Things I like  It is small and easy to carry with the removable plug stored tidily  Once the lids are on the food does not spill if it tips over  It only takes about an hour to go from having cold or semifrozen food to hot food  It does not stink up the office with the smell of heating food  If you inadvertently leave it on for multiple hours 6 or 7 hours in my case it does not scorch the food melt the device or cause it to malfunction  Things you may want to know  Soups chili stews and foods with a lot of sauce will get hotter than relatively dry foods will  Something like chunky rigatoni will be adequately warm compared to something like soup that will be piping hot  The inner lid can be difficult to remove after the food heats up  It helps to slightly loosen it before you start heating your food  If the removable power cord does not fit perfectly when wrapped around the unit try wrapping it in the other direction,5,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024",True

B0BVXDPZP3,The best allaround OLED TV for most people,This is my first OLED TV and all I can say is WOW If youve only had LCD TVs in the past the OLED difference is very noticeable with the infinite contrast and 3D look that it gives to the image My biggest concern with this TV was that it wouldnt be bright enough but even during the day with 3 windows shining light into the room Ive found its plenty bright enough and a lot brighter than the budget LCD TV I had before Vizio M658G1 LG supports everything you could want in terms of gaming with 4 HDMI 21 ports for 4k120Hz Dolby Vision gaming VRR ALLM etc I play Xbox Series X on it and it looks amazing I also play Nintendo Switch and with a few tweaks like upping sharpness to 15 and turning Super Resolution to high it looks almost 4k Everything Ive watched on it looks better than ever before and I cant say enough good things about it After considering all my options I decided on this TV over the other options  Compared to the LG G3 A lot cheaper but with the same processor for equal upscaling and clarity The G3 is noticeably brighter but like I said I havent felt like the C3 wasnt bright enough and it was brighter than I expected  Compared to the Samsung S95C Again much cheaper and the processor is better than that on the S95C so lower quality content will look cleaner especially lower bitrate like YouTube TV The S95C is much brighter and more colorful but Samsung has quality control issues poor firmware updates and no Dolby Vision HDR support  Compared to LG C2 The C3 is very similar to the C2 and its hard to justify the price increase of the C3 It was worth it to me since I got a good deal and only paid a few hundred dollars more The C3 has an improved processor with improved dynamic tone mapping with 20000 zones instead of 5000 and is a little bit brighter It also supports DTS passthrough and QMS unlike the C2 A common complaint about LG OLEDs is their aggressive dimming during prolonged high APL scenes That issue was fixed on the 2023 models Lastly the C3 has a new customizable quick access menu thats nice for changing settings in a snap  Compared to Samsung S90C This is the C3s biggest competition this year because they are close in price The S90C has the better QDOLED panel and is brighter and more colorful I went with the C3 because of the Samsung issues I mentioned above with the S95C I just trust LG more than Samsung as a company to support their products for years to come Also QDOLED appears to have more risk of burnin and I like to keep my TVs for a long time  Compared to Samsung S95B 2022 model I wanted a 77 TV and the S95B only comes in 55 and 65 Also Samsung issues I mentioned before  Conclusion The C3 is probably the best all around OLED TV for most people Everything Ive watched on this looks incredible and LG is a brand you can trust when it comes to OLED Theyve been making them longer than anyone else and theyve figured out how to prevent burnin for the vast majority of users If all you do is watch news or sports channels all day long then OLED probably isnt for you but if you watch a variety of content from movies TV shows gaming etc then I think this might be the best TV you can buy Unless you can afford the LG G3 of course,5,458 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2023",True

B0BVXDPZP3,My new PC monitor,Im using the C3 as a computer monitor I had purchased the G9 Neo a couple years back and have been using that as my main display coupled with a G8  it was TONS of real estate but media consumption was mediocre as the vertical space was the same as a 27 screen so I decided to migrate to a singular large format screen I went back and forth on size and brand between this and the equivalent Samsung offering I checked them out in stores read reviews and the C3s only issue was the protection LG uses to prevent burnin so when the C3 was recently on sale I sprung for it I was aiming for the 55 since it was going to sort of be on my desk wall mount but the 65 was actually a better price at the time It actually was the EXACT same width as my desk and is surprisingly aesthetically pleasing  In terms of performance Ive had a couple things to work through First there are NO Displayports and you pretty much NEED an HDMI 21 cable so I was back on Amz fast tracking a new cable after trying to setup Im powering it currently with a 3080 TI Playing content at 4k 60hz has been terrific but when I bumped my refresh rate to 120 the screen itself started having issues  not my PC or what was on screen but the menu system started choking HARD and slowed down greatly This is actually pretty worrisome to me Ive dealt with Samsung putting a cheap processor in a screen before and the smart stuff starts to crap out over time  so Ill be watching this maybe it is a firmware issue I cant call it yet  In terms of practical use and gaming mostly Helldivers 2 Brotato and Fortnite  all maxed out  it looks fantastic and is a much better experience than my ultrawide despite being close to the same width and it having a 240mhz refresh rate and technically costing less than the G9 when not on sale I was worried about text sharpness but text has been perfectly sharp  the biggest IMO difference between a tv screen and monitor Recently did taxes with wife at the same time on it and even with different forms and documents opened all over the screen at once FancyZones for the win she was able to read everything easily despite needing glasses and being on the far right side It doesnt sound like a big deal but that is kind of huge Media consumption such as Youtube has been a mixed bag  simply put there arent THAT many content creators posting in 4K so everything is being upscaled  with the results being mixed  hard to say whos fault that really is  Finally color and burnin Ive had no burn in but Ive left the device to take care of selfdimming Ive kept it off when not in use and I use animated backgrounds along with hidden taskbars so Im actively defending against it So good so far One of the differences touted between this and the Samsung equivalents is that the Samsungs are brighter  I worry not only will that lead to more burnin but it wouldnt be as comfortable as this has been to use as a monitor  Im sitting a few feet from a 65 screen I dont need the full brightness of the sun pouring into my eyes However and in a good way the darkness hs made the contrast look even better to at least me and that makes the colors look even better Helldivers 2 is not super colorful but I can CLEARLY see all the details Playing Rainbow 6 Siege Ive never felt at a disadvantage due to people blending in or had issues with latency Fortnite is super colorful and just pops off the screen to my delight Brotato as a 2D game doesnt tax the screen resolution but speed that game can move at in later levels has not been affected by latency at ALL and it looks better than it did on my Steamdeck and the colors at least feel better than m G9 though I struggle to separate the color performance here from the scale  It was a weird decision buying this screen as a monitor but Ive ENJOYED using it so much like Ive actually smiled just playing games like L4D2 because the experience has been so good,5,37 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2024",True

B0BVXDPZP3,Probably the best OLED picture on Earth for the money remote control redesign needed,My LG C3 Series 55Inch Class OLED evo 4K Processor Smart Flat Screen TV was offered at a significant discount I think because it was near the end of the model year and nearly identical replacement models would be offered soon and this price swayed my decision Im replacing a nonOLED Sony Bravia which suddenly died after about 5 years of superb performance and value and the obvious choices in my price range were this LG along with the compareable Samsung and Sony models I might have chosen this one anyway but the price reduction was the final factor The picture is amazing and I cant imagine being happier with its performance quality and value However Im backing off from a full 5star review for two reasons the first hesitation regards the LGs antiquated convoluted menu system everything works but it is inconvenient to navigate and use but more so because of the second disappointment LG simply has to redesign this genuinely bad handheld remote control An example of a vexing problem among others with the remote is that based on how one holds a TV remote control the volume buttons here do not fall easily to hand In the dark I have to hunt to locate the center multidirctional control and then feel with my thumb up to a corner control button then up one button to find the volume down and the next one up is volume up Its amazing to me that LG has not long ago developed a practical easy to use remote and it should be backlit as well That said Im overjoyed with this exceptional TV system its value picture quality and extensive adjustability once one has learned and mastered how to accomplish the many functions within the clumsy nonintuitive menu system At the price I paid I could not have done better Next time I might spring for the Sony because the Andriod TV operating system is superior and easier to use and because of Sonys superior and unmatched picture processing power the LG is near perfect but no question that  with a nod to the also very good Samsung had the prices been closer I would have opted for the Sony not least because Ive been a Sony owner since the Trinitron days when I in my youth used to sell them at a well known major retail chain and their televisions as well as most of their other electronics are brilliantly engineered LG builds great stuff but in this case has some work to do starting with the menu system and this bloodly cantankerous failure of a remote,4,9 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2024",True
B0BVXDPZP3,I love this TV,I shopped around for a good while even going to the big box stores to compare various TVs on offer from the various makers and this model stood out after multiple visits and time spent researching options and price ranges and sizes  The picture quality always jumped out at me as the best out of all the wide options I encountered  After pulling the trigger on this unit I am absolutely glad I choose this model  I wouldnt even say glad more like thrilled  The quality of the picture is far beyond the best Ive seen  We have a very nice high end TV at home already for comparison thats fairly new and at the top end  So I do have a comparison point  We just needed another set for another room in the place and it was time to buy  I took some time in the settings to explore what everything could do had a run with the AI features of this set and did some manual adjustments to all the various things to get this working and displaying exactly how I want my picture to look and I was able to land exactly where I wanted in the sweet spot with very little stress at all  And the audio  The AI enhanced setting is just phenomenal  I didnt even bother putting in a sound bar even though I had one laying around  Its just so clear and crisp with nice deep lows that dont rattle but do rumble  This TV gets loud if you want it  I also game on this now and it puts out a stunning 120hz at 4k that just absolutely sings to the eyes  Using my PS5 to feed the image its never looked better and Ive been 4k gaming for a long time now  Its just never looked better  I am thoroughly impressed by LG after buying this it was my first one from them and Id be hard pressed to go with another make after this as I truly feel that Im spoiled now by it  Nothing else looks as good to me  Even watching older shows this brings them to life in new ways and the fidelity is so ramped up by the on board features of this set that it makes watching literally anything a pleasure  I usually have no patience for kids shows for example but when the grandkids came to visit shortly after we got this I was just as glued to watching them as they were  The colors the fluidity of motion the crisp detailjust pure eye candy  And for a visual device like this thats the highest praise I can give it  Its heavy in case youre wondering about that  Even at 48 I only felt secure moving this around the house with two grown people handling it carefully  Its got weight to it  In summary this TV is not only the best TV Ive ever owned its literally the best quality Ive ever seen  Even among family and friends or display models in store  I feel like its from the future or something at least a couple years out compared to everything else  I have no higher praise to give this than what Ive said and it was nothing for me to say it  No exaggeration or imagination required this is just stream of thought and these are genuinely the things that came to mind when I felt it was time to review I cant help but gush about this set it deserves the praise  I feel my life itself would lose a little bit of color if I had to give this up and it brings me actual mental comfort knowing I have this and can relax after a long day looking at it  Its one of those things where youre looking at it and often think and even remark things like This looks better than real life huh,5,36 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2024",True
B0BVXDPZP3,I love the picture quality and the sound is pretty good,UPDATE 6132024  It took a while but I solved the problem of controlling the volume  The remotes change the sound bars volume while the LG TV volume is frozen at max  I dont know if I would purchase this TV again  The instructions are terrible and I still cant use a few buttons on the remote  The brightness is on maximum and some of the dark scenes are still too dark  The TV talks to me when it hears things from the show Im watching and I cannot figure out how to shut it off or use it  I wish I could find out how everything works UPDATE 1 I finally figured out most of the remote control issues 2 The manuals are insufficient and their website isnt any better for helping program the TV or remote 3 The remote doesnt light up so its difficult to use in a dark room This television replaced a 10 year old 40 inch Samsung 3D TV  The picture is amazing  So much better than the old Samsung  I purchased this model because after doing research I found that its 2022 version was rated the best in 4 different magazines  I decided to purchase the newer model to take advantage of any improvements  Im glad I did  It has a lot of settings to play with or you can let it set them itself  Its definitely a smart TV When setting it up it asks you questions that allow its remote to control many cable box functions  It even has your cable companys guide  There are a few things that bother me 1  The manuals for the TV and remote are terribly insufficient  They dont tell you near enough to operate either well 2 The remote is quirky although I am getting use to it  It uses point and click technology  You aim the dot on the screen at the setting and click a scrolling button to change it  It definitely takes some getting use to 3 Most of the cable sockets are on the side of the TV  When you use them the cables stick out of the side and are visible from the front  I purchased right angle attachments so the cables stick out backwards and dont show 4  I have FiOS cable a Chromecast with Google TV and a Samsung sound bar  I mention this because no matter what I try I cannot get one remote to control the volumes when watching Cable and the Google TV properly  The only possibility was using Bluetooth however then the sound was out of sync and the settings on the TV and the sound bar are greyed out  It could be due to the sound bar being 8 years old and a different brand than the TV Granted these issues take some getting use to  Im considering getting a new sound bar to solve the sound issue Im just not sure  All totalled Im still very happy with the LG OLED TV,4,93 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2023",True
B0BVXDPZP3,Everything you need to know to make an informed decision,Setting up this TV and learning its quirky remote and navigation system and its constant need to be managed and adjusted wont be something everyone wants to deal with For other reasons this wont be a good TV for everyone  as it fills a very specific need and only performs well in certain conditions but in those conditions it is exceptional  I will get into the specifics below  As a Gaming display  Console Games looks amazing  my ps5 looks so much better than I thought possible and even my Nintendo switch with its limited hardware and resolution looks simply incredible  Gaming consoles just come on when you activate them through the controller there is no  need to manually select the proper input  The LG remote actually works on the PlayStation and Switch Menus which is more useful than you would think especially when navigating the game stores  When the TV is off just activating a console controller will turn both the TV and console on and put you at the console home menu  While a game console is active the Settings menu completely changes to what looks like an LG Monitor and has a new set of custom options specifically for gaming  The pixel response time is insane  We are talking like 3ms or less 120 FPS is impressive but remember youll only see this on supported games  Consoles and there arent many right now  As a Television  Streaming TV  Ive never spent more time using a TVs menu system and having to constantly adjust and reset things just to watch a show or change to a different streaming platform  WEB OS is by far the worst TV operating system out of the gate however once you take the time to set it up  find the menus and options that let you turn off the censory overload launch pad I think eventually most people will be good with it and get used to it  get used to getting new notifications you habe to manually delete almost everytime you turn on your TV  When you pause your show the Screensaver comes on fast  which is great definitely what you want with OLED However I found everytime my Screensaver comes on my HDMI Soundbar disconnects and the TV speakers get activated  No way to customize the screen saver  No pausing OTA Tv via USB Jump Drive support at all This means if you use an antenna to get local channels you have no way to pause live TV  The default settings and the pre programmed settings may not work for you and it may take a really long time for you to dial it in  True Motion is the worst feature Ive seen on a TV and I have no idea why its on by default Out of the box I felt like the TV just looked weird to jittery  to sharp  so much color and contrast and too much fluid motion somehow all at once All the shows looked like a budget Soap Opera or watching someones home movies from a VHS recording  I tried all the default and pre made settings and none of them looked good to me  Even the custom picture wizard feature that is supposed to help you design your optimal picture preference by showing you various images and asking you which one you prefer was a total waste of time for me It was not until I got into the advanced settings and turned the True Motion completely Off and made a ton of other adjustments to the sharpness and other settings that I finally got the picture I expected but for some reason those settings dont always apply when changing apps or inputs  so I would spend 5 minutes in the menus just changing the picture for each specific input  streaming app however once its set its set and will remember your settings when you change inputs it is also very easy to switch back and forth between different visual profiles The Sound from the TV itself is better quality than any TV Ive ever heard i didnt know flat tvs could deliver such amazing sound but that said of all the sound settings it seems that Atmos only sounds good in Cinema Mode The AI sound mode is another total failure of features I have my TV mounted to a wall arm so the TV sets out and away from the wall a good 18 inches  With the TV essentially floating with space all around and behind it in this set up I can say the speakers are good enough you probably that I dont need a sound system  but I dont know how good it would sound on a stand or flush mounted to the wall  The low end sound isnt really there its better than most TV speakers though  The sound is crazy Inconsistent  there is no sound normalization feature like you find on even the cheapest TV I think the AI sound is supposed to do this but it just doesnt work I am constantly adjusting the volume from channel to app to console and where as the TV remembers your visual preferences when switching it does not do the same with audio  The TV focuses more on gimmicky ideas that dont work like AI integration rather than using existing systems that do work  When you start it up for the first time they want you to agree to around 7 different user agreements  some of which are 3rd party companies collecting your data You only have to agree to the first 2 LG agreements to make the TV work so make sure you know what youre consenting too rather than just pressing agree to all  The frame is tiny maybe 14 inch on the sides and top and only slightly bigger at the bottom no LG logo  just clean and classy The inputs are well placed and concealed well on the left side of the TV left side from viewers point of view the panel is so thin and the design is so clean even the back of the TV looks amazing The Picture is gorgeous from almost any angle Having Pixels shut off for true Black is so much more visually impressive than it sounds No light bleed No Bloom The screen is very glossy which is a plus and a minus It really adds to the depth and quality of the picture  However  the slightest amount of light coming towards the TV screen will essentially turn the screen into a mirror If you look at the 2 pictures i posted you can clearly see in the first picture the reflection of a single 40 watt Lamp that is 15 feet away from the screen Definately a TV best for dark spaces but it can work okay in a lit room if you crank up the brightness and a few other settings Still the TV surface is highly reflective no matter what and the best way to light a room with this TV is with lighting behind the TV TV really performs in dark rooms and seems designed for that purpose which is what I bought it for but the fact that the remote doesnt light up is really a huge miss for me considering what these TVs cost the remote could be better in several ways  Eye care mode  Low power mode  are nice features and the picture still looks amazing running with low power and reduced blue light  Its a small thing but I LOVE that you can turn off the power  standby light  As a PC Monitor  While some may have great success with this as a Monitor  there are so mant variables you need to consider The TV software can cause more issues than you can imagine while some people may have zero issue  I use LG Monitors and they are amazing  but this is a TV it is NOT designed to be a Monitor and when LG calls it a Gaming TV they really are thinking about consoles and that is where this TV is simply amazing  The Remote  The remote is bloated with to many buttons  no backlight  Doesnt use an type of standard format for Home Back and Options button location  Select Button is also a scroll wheel that often gets scrolled rather than pressed This can cause all kinds of problems  Nintendo Wii style magic wand is an interesting idea that some people may like but most will find it annoying and just another element of using this TV that requires an extra step I hated it for about an hour now I think its amazing  However i could see some people may never like this remote  important buttons are to small and not placed in an ergonomically comfortable position  What its like Watching Shows and Movies on this TV I know OLED is supposed to be much safer for the eyes but I found the no matter how much I tweeked the TV it was hard to look at as It seemed to mess with my neurology while watching Shows this was something that i felt intensely at first it almost gave me anxiety Over the course of about 7 days Ive completely adjusted to it and now it seems much easier on my eyes than my QLED  Ultimately I am happy with the purchase  because I have it in a very dark room and I do a lot if gaming so it is exactly what I need and at the right price  as far oleds go  Conclusion  In my Opinion console gaming and Dark Room viewing is were this TV really excels and in that specific set of conditions I give it 5 Stars While it does look amazing for games id say maybe only 20 better than qled so its up to you if this large of an investment is worth that small of an improvement because this TV really only excels when it comes to comsole gaming and dark room viewing,4,24 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2024",True
B0BVXDPZP3,Some weird software bugs but otherwise great,Whenever I start my game systems it keeps asking me if I want to use passthrough instead of digital sound  I keep saying yes  Ive gone into the settings to set it to permanently go to passthrough so I wont receive the popup but that didnt resolve it  I contacted LG support who couldnt get it working either so they had me to a hard reset unplug the TV hold down the physical power button for a minute then plug the TV back on and go back in to configure the passthrough settings  That resolved it for one or two game sessions and then it just started doing it again on its own  So thats really annoying  In addition to that the Magic Remote that comes with the TV has good button layout but has a really frustrating cursor on the screen that LG decided to not let you turn off permanently and it keeps selecting other apps than what you want  I lived with that on my 48 TV for almost a year before I found out they have a cheaper remote you can get that does not have the cursor on it thats less than 10 dollars at the time of this writing  If you are equally frustrated by the magic remote cursor like most people are you can get this remote instead  Its called Original LG AKB75095307 Smart TV Remote  I highly recommend that remote  The button layout is worse than the magic remote but youll never have that frustrating cursor anymore  As for the picture quality and performance its great  LG really knows how to make OLED TVs  The picture quality is supreme especially in Film Maker mode in a dim or dark room and in gaming mode it performs perfectly for high intensity gaming systems  I have an XBox Series X XBox Classic N64 and Classic NES Mini if that helps give any ideas  The XBox Series X that I have has the most modern and high intensity games and the TV works perfectly for those games  It has the option for a stand or wall mount I opted for the latter  Its not too heavy  They recommend using two people to wall mount the TV but I was able to do it by myself without any problem because the TV doesnt weigh that much  It also provides several HDMI ports including with eARC on the back of the TV  With the 48 C3 the ports were nearly flush with the left side of the TV which I didnt like because the cords stick out on the left side of the TV however this 65 TV has the ports much further in behind the TV so you can hide the cords very easily  Overall aside from the software bugs with passthrough and the very bad Magic Remote where LG wants to force you to use their cursor with no option to turn it off even though most people hate it  aside from those things the TV itself is wonderful  The only other comment I have is its terribly expensive  I think the regular price is too much IMHO however since the C3 is now last years model and last years model is almost identical to the 2024 model it doesnt matter if you get the C3 version but youll find the C3 is many hundreds of dollars cheaper than the 2024 C4 version  So I highly recommend going with the C3 version and save yourself a lot of money for virtually no difference in quality  I gave it 4 stars because of the software bugs that LG doesnt seem to want to fix and also due to their desire to force people to use their magic remote cursor on the screen  If it wasnt for those two things this TV would have 5 stars handsdown  Very Nice TV  Highly Recommended,4,6 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2024",True

B0B1N5FK48,Definite Upgrade from the Blink Outdoor 3,We have been using the Blink Outdoor 3 on the outside of our garage for a few years now  Our driveway faces a different street than our front door and I hated not being able to see out that way when kids were outside playing or during bus pickup and drop off during the school year  The system as a whole has its issues  It will only work as good as your internet for one  That corner of our house is almost like a dead zone for electronics  Its impossible to get WiFi in the garage and the laundry room on that side is notorious for dropping Bluetooth  But thats not something I can change other than maybe getting a mesh system and I dont really care enough to try  Because of this and that I use it for live view a lot for bus pickup in the mornings our outdoor camera has been the most loathed  You can only live view for 5 minutes at the most  After that the camera will disconnect and try to reconnect for an ungodly amount of timeusually when the kids are getting on the busand by the time I get it back the kids and bus are gone  Then I get endless warning messages about high usage on my device I change batteries every 23 months because of how we use that particular camera which is super annoying  I live in Minnesota and it gets pretty darn cold in the winter  The cameras will not work in subzero temperatures  I believe that has to do more with the lithium batteries than the camera but be advised that if it gets cold enough youre outofluck and will likely have to change all your batteries out after  I bought the 3 outdoor camera deal plus a Blink Mini during Octs Prime Day so we could replace the one on the garage and add an additional two on the back and other side of the house  It actually came with a Sync Module 2 which I wasnt aware of and was a pleasant surprise  My first Blink system was purchased before Amazon bought the company so we have been using the original Sync Module  Because of that reason we are grandfathered in and never have to pay a monthly fee for storage  For what its worth this is the ONLY reason we stick with Blink despite wanting to potentially try other camera brands  All that said the Outdoor 4 is a vast improvement  The camera angle is wider and clearer and I appreciate the durable coating on the outside  I still have it attached in outdoor plastic housing but its good to know I wouldnt have to  It is quite a bit thicker than the 3 so if you have that gen and bought plastic housing before the 4 was offered youll have to upgrade it  Most housing offered now will work with both 3 and 4 but anything made specifically for the 3 will be too thin for the 4 if that makes sense  We all LOVE the fact that we get person warnings instead of just a general notification ie a person is at your garage  I have no idea if thats a camera upgrade a Sync Module 2 upgrade or a software upgrade but it helps a TON  With 3 outdoor cameras and a doorbell its nice to not have to check the recording right away if its not a person that sets it off  I am looking forward to the new Sync Module being released as it improves WiFi range for the Outdoor 4 and comes with scheduling capabilities  Right now you can only add a schedule for your system as a whole  It would be nice to be able to add a schedule for each camera independently,5,136 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2024",True

B0B1N5FK48,Very Easy setup,I purchased these after reading other reviews and they are extremely easy to set up the app is easy to install and the video quality is extremely clear You do not need electrical lines for these battery operated cameras I have one sink module and I have four cameras and the doorbell connected The only drawback I find is if the camera is too far away from your WiFi it does use a lot of battery power I have since ordered the new sync module which allows a 400 ft distance between the sink module and the camera Overall I think these are a great option for people who want a fast easy setup and installation I would highly recommend these cameras and I would definitely buy them again,5,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2024",True
B0B1N5FK48,Not as advertised works with issues,These work for my purpose but dont have too high expectations  For me so far I have not gotten 2 year battery life on three of the 6 cameras I own  On two its been less then month an half battery life and I put pretty good name brand batteries in  The video quality is fine but you only get 30 to 60 seconds then it stops recording regardless of what it is recording  The motion detection exclusion zones dont work very well  I have a camera with a street along the top totally excluded and its constantly picking up and recording the traffic  The night time recording is pretty fuzzy  but ok for my purposes  I bought these to detect what kinds of critters roam around my house  For that they work fine though there been a few times the video stopped when I would like to have had it continue to record  The people detection is pretty good but you need the subscription for that feature I believe which I have  The app is ok it has all the features I need  Connectivity is OK at best if you get notification of motion and want to check it can be an annoying amount of time to get connected to the live view  I have a couple of cameras where the wait can be quite long wait maybe a minute and sometime not at all  I would say on average 10 to 20 seconds to get connected for live view  Then you have to keep hitting continue every 30 seconds to continue to watch  So the camera position relative to the receiver is important two of my cameras have quite a bit of building material to go through to get to the receiver even though they are on 30 to 40 feet away  I would also locate them where they are easy to get two sine you may have to change batteries more then you planned  The primary advantage is easy installation no wire etc just batteries  I got better camera mounts for these cameras you can see in the attached photo  These are pretty cheap but work just be sure you tighten the mount well  Over all if you plan to buy be sure you know what you are getting else you will be disappointed,3,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024",True
B0B1N5FK48,Very Good System  Price Read My Detailed Review,Overall Im very happy with the Blink camera system and Im not paying for the subscription One of the reasons I decided to buy into this system was because I didnt need a subscription for 1 Live view option which means see the live video from the cameras any time I want via the app from anywhere  2 Save videos that were triggered by motion to a USB flash drive memory stick inside my house not cloud only and not stored in the camera itself Keep in mind most of my comments here will be related to using the system without a subscription but Ill comment on the differences where possible Also my comments may be a little more technical than most people would like but for anyone interested Im being as detailed as possible  These comments are relevant as of Feb 2024 the date I wrote this review  ViewingStoring Your Videos During the trial subscription period when I could view my motiontriggered saved videos in the cloud I noticed the videos loadplay quicker than if youre accessing the videos stored on the USB flash drive in the Sync Module 2 Anyway not a big deal but its a difference You need to provide a USB flash drive to plug in to the Sync Module but those are very cheap these days and a 128GB drive will give you TONS of storage for videos since the file size of the videos is not very big Also with the cloud subscription theres a thumbnail for each video saved which can be helpful in finding important videos if youre trying to find one with people in it rather than a video triggered by a dog Without a subscription theres no thumbnail on the saved videos which you view in your app and it takes several seconds for them to loadplay in your app but its bearable The nice thing is if you dont have a subscription the videos save to your flash drivememory stick in the Sync Module 2 immediately after the recording is finished If you have a subscription the videos only download to your Sync Modules USB flash drive once per day at night as I understand it  Sync Module 2  Wireless Signals to WiFi  Cameras  The Sync Module is required for the cameras but you get one of those if you buy a package like I did I bought the bundle that included two Outdoor 4 cameras one video doorbell and the Sync Module 2 Its important to know the Sync Module and the cameras have TWO wireless signals One that needs to connect to your home or business 24GHz WiFi network and one that is only for use by the Sync Module and cameras and that signal is a LowFrequency Radio LFR signal It does not have 5GHz but you dont want that anyway because the 5GHz signal is weaker than 24GHz signal The Sync Module is where you connect a USB flash drive memory stick to save your videos if youre not paying for a subscription and also for oncedaily backups of your videos if you ARE paying for a subscription PLACEMENT OF THE SYNC MODULE IS IMPORTANT Remember it has TWO signals It needs to be placed in an area that has a good signal to your homebusiness WiFi AND so that it also has a good signal to all your cameras if you have them spread out in different areas around your home or outside your home To give you some perspective my house is a singlestory ranch style house around 1700 sq ft and I have a camera outside on each wall each wall is brick I was able to place the Sync Module and my WiFi access point in the center of my house Even in this central location I have one camera the video doorbell about 38 away from sync module and WiFi access point that has only 2 to 3 bars out of 4 for the WiFi connection but usually 4 bars for the Sync Module connection Long story short make sure you place the sync module your WiFi access point and the cameras so they all connect to each other with as strong a signal as possible for best performancereliability It worked out well for my house especially since I have flexibility on where I can place my sync module and home WiFi access point and the technical knowledge and tools to move it wherever I needed it  Outdoor 4 Camera  The image qualityexposure for these cameras is very good The nighttime IR infrared view is very good also it will appear like black and white footage The coverage of the IR light when its dark is also very good and has better coverage than I would have expected I have motiontriggered flood lights outside my house anyway so if my lights are triggered the camera may not use IR because it sees enough light at that point it will record normal video in color just like it does during daylight I bought 25 ft long thirdparty USBC cords with a power supply to use as the power source for my Outdoor 4 cameras so I never have to replace batteries and so I can view live video from the cameras as much as I want and also have the infrared light set to High without impacting battery life because there are no batteries to worry about  I dont know if its different WITH a subscription but the longest period you can record when the camera is triggered by motion is 60 seconds For the video doorbell the max record time per motion trigger is 30 seconds just so you know Regarding the power I drilled a hole in the bricks of my house in the mortar actually to feed power to my Outdoor 4 cameras One camera is directly under a soffit so theres no danger of rain getting in there where the power cord connects but the cord I bought is weather sealed anyway not a normal USBC cord The other camera is mounted under a thirdparty security camera cover to keep the sun from beating down on it all summer its on a south wall and to keep rain off it just in casebecause again I decided to power this one by a cord that plugs into the back of the camera instead of using the batteries The included mount is very nice and flexible If you mount an Outdoor 4 camera under a white security camera cover like I did you may need to paint the underside of that cover with flat black paint because at night in my case the infrared light reflected off the underside of the covershield Im using over my outdoor 4 camera and that made the video made difficult to see clearly Daylight videos were unaffected it was just at night in low light when the IR light was active for video recording that was a problem with that aftermarket cover I bought  Doorbell Camera  For the video doorbell the max record time per motion trigger is 30 seconds Why I dont know Technical limitations The Outdoor 4 cameras can record 60 seconds of motion triggered video The wireless signals for the doorbell camera seem to be a little weaker than the outdoor 4 cameras One big disappointment is that the video doorbell camera can NOT be powered by your existing doorbell power wire My old Skybell brand video doorbell CAN be powered by the doorbell wires so its a bummer that Blink cant do the same You can connect your existing doorbell wires to trigger your indoor doorbell so thats goodbut like I said you cant use that wire to power the video doorbell I confirmed this with Blink tech support I hope they have a new version in the future that is able to be powered solely by the doorbell power wires but for now I have to keep batteries in it The video doorbell device has a weaker infrared IR light than the Outdoor 4 cameras and lesser quality video than the Outdoor 4 cameras but overall its good especially during daylight hours The included mount is very nice and easy to install  Motion Triggering of Videos  Privacy  The settingscustomization for when motion triggers video recording is very good You have the option to block out as much of the scene as you need to to prevent unwanted triggering of video recordings such an area of the scene where tree limbs often blow around or something like that For privacy you have the option to block out 2 custom size areas in the scene you select for privacy reasons so that area in the video is grayed out The selected privacy area does not trigger when motion happens in that privacy section and also when other sections in the scene that you allow to be seen trigger video the video thats recorded has a gray box in the privacy section all you see is a gray box Thats pretty powerful and useful if you need it Regarding motion triggered video recording in general Ive noticed the cameras can accidentally trigger record when its really mistyfoggy outside If theres a lot of mist in the air floating by the motion sensor it can trigger a recording Just something to keep in mind because you may need to adjust the motion sensitivity andor disarm the cameras for a while until the mist clears because you may be getting lots of unwantedaccidental recordings I have mine adjusted to the point where the cameras almost never accidentally record unless its very misty outside which isnt too often where I am  Audio Quality  The microphones on the Outdoor 4 and video doorbell camera pick up sound very well I can clearly hear anyone speaking The closer they are the better of course but its very good The speaker volume for the cameras is very good as well Its plenty loud and if anyone is nearby when you activate the camera and start speaking theyll hear it clearly   Blink App for Phone  The app you can download on your phone for managing the camerassync module is very nice and has plenty of options to configurecustomize the cameras motion settings video quality audio settings check status etc The app is where you view your videos but of course if youre storing videos on the flash drive connected to the sync module you can remove that flash drive and plug it in to your computer to see the video files there or make copies of the files for longterm storagebut of course you can also use the app to save a video file to your phone if you want to keep a copy of share it with someone like the cops  I wish they had an app for Windows so I could view the cameras live and see saved videos on the sync modules flash drive right from my computer but at this point theres no PC app I think there used to be onebut if there was there isnt one now Feb 2024  Price  I compared the price of this system and what it can do with other systems like Ring Nest and Skybell and at this time the price difference is significant in my opinion The Blink system and what it offers even without a subscription is better than the other systems I checked out,5,"2,513

B0B1N5FK48,Decent Upgrade Update 8SEP2024,Just received this today and it does show an improvement on the quality Feels and looks beefier When updating your activity zones there are more squares to select than the previous versions of these cameras which I like to fine tune the areas I want  And I think the inactive zones you set up are actually enforced and work as expected than the older generation cameras  TIP 25 September 2023  For those having issues about wifi signal strength you may need to mess with the routers settings to increase signal power If your router is between walls behind the tv etc you will see degradation in performance and responsiveness in live view I have a gaming router set on a high shelf because routers work best when theyre in a high spot My cameras that are outside have no issues with WiFi strength and are responsive when liveviewing  Field of view has improved significantly and you can see a large difference between versions of cameras  Good thing is that the mounts for the previous cameras WILL work on this camera The mount it came with is an improvement to previous versions Flat base not coneshaped  Im currently trying the person detection from the trial with this camera and will update over time on the performancePerson Detection since having BO4 as the trial has been great It has significantly cut down on the amount of unwanted notifications caused by wind carsensor lights animals etc I do feel that you can save battery life significantly even when the sensitively is set higher Having too many notifications does get annoying at times but I think Blink is definitely making an initiative to make these camera a gamerchanger while still maintaining ease of setup  Price is a tad high but you may consider the monthly payments which I did  28 August 2023  Taking a snapshotphoto capture from these cameras at night nonnight vision pointing in a lighted area is sharper than any previous version No images included due to security Havent tried night vision alone but Im confident the same sharpness is applied  29 August 2023  The Motion Recording Types cover Person Detection and All Motion I have one camera set with Person Detection enabled with sensitivity level at 8 and it didnt detect me driving my car inout of the garage I wouldve thought Person Detection would encompass some normal motions but I think we must take it at face value that when set to Person Detection it will ONLY detect persons you dont get the best of both worlds unless selecting All Motion Sounds dumb to say but though Id make it aware Update On a very few instances this camera did detect my car entering and exiting our garage So my thoughts originally have shifted but I think over time with continued firmware updates it will hone in on its accuracy  1 September 2023  One camera fell offlineunresponsive Suspicion is on firmware updates being applied or weather factors since its low 60 outside No issues with home network or signal strength to camera Will continue to monitorself troubleshoot I took out the batteries and tested them showing still a full chargehealth and placed them back in bringing the camera back online  4 September 2023  One of my BO4 cameras with Person Detection enabled was at level 8 sensitivity and on a windy day did alert that there was a person at insert camera name It alerted a few times during the day under 5 instances but not a big deal My guess would be that as BO4 continues to develop the accuracy will improve in its detection  8 September 2023  Setup of 3rd BO4 camera set in an area where there is minimalno lights Due to security no images Taking Live Photo with the IR intensity set at LOW Some hazinessfuzziness but the area is lit up and provides better detail than previous versions of Blink cameras As you increase in IR sensitivity the Live Photo in HIGH IR setting increased in sharpness and reduces glare and fuzziness significantly I placed some solar floodlights in the area of this BO4 and with low IR sensitivity and once the lights are triggered the video capture was much sharper than previous versions of Blink cameras I only have video quality set at normal so Im impressed with BO4 so far  28 September 2023 Another BO4 fell offline around 11pm Last occurrence was due to a firmware update being deployed so this may be due to the same thing  1 October 2023  Installed my 4th BO4 as Im looking at all the point of views both in the live shot and live view it feels that it elongates everything I know my driveway isnt that long but comparing it to previous generation cameras BO4 view appears to add like 20ft to my driveway I can understand the other reviews concerned about the range detection as I do notice some times it will not catch movement especially if Im moving slowly or based on camera positioning but at sensitivity level 89 I would like to catch movement at a farther range As I continue to implement BO4 I will continue to observe performance  6 October 2023  It appears one of my BO4s point toward the road at max sensitivity IS NOT catching cars passing by anymore Seems that v1334 that was pushed out affected the range despite any setting changes Not a concern yet but Im hoping newer updates will fix range issues and sensitivity Update  camera seems to be capturing movement now at a lower sensitivity set at 67 Mayve been a change in traffic flow by the house in which there may be less cars however will continue to observe BO4 performance  4 November 2023  Installed another BO4 camera while also upgrading one camera with a battery expansion kit This is specifically for BO4 cameras not previous versions The expansion makes this camera much heavier however the mounts they come with and previous will support the weight without the mount droopingmoving Im not a fan of adding more bulk to the camera Also this battery expansion will not use cameras battery slots and instead uses the expansion for 4 batteries I wouldve preferred an integration that wouldve retained the two onboard batteries  two for expansion Other than that the BO4 cameras have been wonderful to use with overall qualitysharpness I do hope that future updates will improve motion detection and range respectively Nonetheless these are worth an upgrade from previous versions  15 November 2023  Ive noticed recently that BO4 will notify of Motionperson and it will not record that instance It happens sporadically so it is a slight concern but not enough deter me from purchasing another BO4 Over time as more updates are pushed to these cameras I expect the overall effectiveness will improve  6 December 2023  BO4 has been a great upgrade for my system There are still occasions where Ill receive a notification of movement but does not record that moment Its very rare now with the update to v1341 I still see issues regarding the sensitivity not working as expected One camera is set at 9 toward the road and it does not always catch cars driving by Not a showstopper but I can see now its range detection could be an issue for others With recent Blink app updates you now can adjust the length of video recording previously it was adjusted by every 5 seconds which is great Allows for better customization for your needs I wish this was the same for the sensitivity 099 vs 19 Overall BO4 has been accurate with Person Detection and the subscription for Blink Plus for 10mon is very reasonable for any household to use to expand features  27 January 2024  BO4 has been working exceptionally well I still have the Blink Plus subscription to allow the Person Detection feature and its accurate There were certain instances that BO4 cameras did not record movement such as my neighbor chopping his tree down I also noticed there were connectivity issues during that time that left a large gap in my list of recordings Not a showstopper but concerning for those security moments Range also plays a factor in detection so I continue to hope that future updates will improve this Overall upgrading to this camera is well worth it Wait for the sales to get these at a cheaper price  16 February 2024  Decided to update the Blink Sync Module because I realized I was still using the 1st generation sync module I updated to the 2nd generation sync module and I noticed theres more of a delay when live streaming my cameras I did a reboot of the sync module a few times but I still receive a slight delay One camera I have at a longer distance is unable to be live viewed despite WiFi and sync module connection have full barsstrong connectivity Still attempting to troubleshoot but I think something about the firmware I updated to since its the first time connecting Further investigation is needed Overall the cameras are working as expected  18 February 2024  Identified that the issue was NOT the Sync Module 2 and rather my own internet Reboot modem router and network switch and saw significant improvement in BO4 camera responsiveness Additionally I will take into factor that weather was not great at the time of incident Since this the Blink cameras are working as intended  22 April 2024  Ive bumped up to the yearly Blink Plus subscription as the Person Detection feature has been wonderful Eliminated unnecessary notifications caused by wind sunshadows or other movement It does save your batteries  There are occasions where there is a notification of movement however it does not recordsave the video Not sure if there are delays but I continue to have confidence as new firmware is pushed to BO4 it will improve overall performance Since having these cameras I havent had major issues and Blink support have been helpful and receptive  Other things Ive noticed as far as delays in live streaming are caused by your upload speeds The higher your upload speeds are the quicker the response is Additionally consider adjusting your WiFi strength from your routerwireless access point as this also contributes to the responsiveness  Overall I am pleased with Blink Outdoor 4 cameras  8SEP2024  BO4 Cameras have been great When pairing it with the Blink subscription for cloud storage and the Person Detection feature its helps with cutting down unnecessary movements caused by animalsshadowsetc  Occasionally I would still receive Blink app notifications for movement but it will not record it Not sure if this is still an ongoing bug or late push notifications from previous captures but it doesnt impact my rating for the product  I wish detection sensitivity was improved or expanded upon to allow for timely capture of events,5,"1,274 people found this helpful","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2023",True

B08TRTZS1T,DONT BUY THIS ITEM UNTILUNLESS YOU READ MY COMMENT THROUGH AND UNDERSTAND,10232023  I saw this fire retardant blanket advertised online and watched a video clip of it in action used during a mockup of a kitchen fire It appeared to be a reasonable product and very simple to use I planned to  keep one available for both my own homes upstairs and downstairs The package containing each blanket discloses only that the item is made in China and that it is constructed with woven fiberglass   I opened a single package for the first time to show my wife preparing to demonstrate it to her I pulled the blanket out of its plastic packaging opened it to its full extent laid it out on our first floor carpeting and quickly smoothed it out all with my bare hands Immediately that I did as I describe I felt innumerable pinprick sensations all over the palms and backs of both of my hands as if I had clutched at a plant covered with tiny thorns The last time I recall such an experience was decades ago when I handled unpackaged insulating material in an attic with bare hands But I stress that there is no unpackaged material visible here when one pulls the blanket out of its package it appears to be a selfcontained unit completely enclosing its contents in an offwhite material Only then does one realize that the entire item inside and out appears to be fiberglass All the way through and through from its surface through to its interior to its underside Nothing comes between your bare skin and the fiberglass surface which sheds fiberglass particles embedding themselves in your flesh every moment you handle this material The more you handle it the more your skin stings pains and itches It feels a little like dozens of simultaneous tiny insect bites on your palms the backs of your hands and between the fingers  Im a physician in particular a respiratory physician Exposure to small particles of glasslike materials otherwise termed silicates is to be avoided not only for skin contact but also for airborneinhalational contact It has no beneficial purpose on your skin or in your lungs quite the opposite  I packed up the blanket kept my wife far away from it and vacuumed the carpet area where the blanket had been unfolded I inspected the blanket closely before I put it away I could not see any visible loose fibers with the naked eye or with a magnifying glass I inspected my hands also again the fibers are so tiny they were not visible I washed my hands thoroughly with warm soapy water That soothed most of the stinging To be complete in the description no rash developed then or later and no bleeding occurred at any time But also I had occasion to leave my home later in the evening The weather was cold and I wore weatherappropriate gloves while driving and walking to and from my car I washed my hands again thoroughly that night before going to bed I was also careful not to touch my wife with my bare hands  The following morning almost all stinging and itching had resolved But I noticed upon donning the cold weather gloves I wore the night before a similar but milder experience occurred again stinging and itching I have no doubt some of the fiberglass particles got out of my skin and were left behind in my gloves while I wore them  Today is day 3 following the first exposure I have no residual symptoms My gloves feel fine  To summarize  1 Im saying nothing about the fire retardant capacities of this item Ive had no experience to test it for its stated use I suspect it probably works exactly as advertised I can say that nothing on the packaging that came with the item warns the user of any possible adverse effects such as I have described I also want to say here that by identifying the site where the product was manufactured I intend no political statement Shoddy goods can come from anywhere  2 I am saying also that its not my intention to make a mountain out of a relatively small experience No lasting damage seems to have occurred  3 If you want to purchase this item I advise you to wear appropriate gloves and avoid any other contact between the item and unprotected skin especially the face Wearing a mask when using it is probably advisable If you have the presence of mind to don a mask and gloves before using a fire retardant blanket during a home fire emergency you are a cooler customer than I  4 I plan to return the blankets I purchased to Amazon expecting a full refund I suggest to Amazon that you drop this item completely and cease marketing it immediately If you have current orders for it at least advise your customers to read my comments here  5 There must be a superior product for a comparable price available somewhere No one should have this experience  Respectfully  George Goodman,1,"4,136 people found this helpful","Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2023",True
B08TRTZS1T,BEWARE OF SMALL FIBERGLASS SHARDS THAT GET IN YOUR SKIN WHEN HANDLING,Just got this product today and was happy to have something in case of a small fire and was going to give some to family members I took the blanket out of the package to check it out and immediately felt tons of fiberglass shards getting in my hands from simply touching it Its like prickles all over your hands and not easily visible to the naked eye because they are so small Theres NO warning about this on the product whatsoever which I cant believe Im returning these tomorrow I now see that many others in the reviews have said the same thing,1,6 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2024",False

B08TRTZS1T,DO NOT USE NOT SAFE,Hey so I grabbed this as a safe alternative for my family because it seemed less likely to make them nervous They had children and me as in their commercials so safe and prepared family right  I went to take it out of the packaging to show my kids what to do when I pulled the blanket out I was SHOWERED in loose fiberglass Covered from my chest to my toes My stove my kids jacket everywhere  I had to cut myself out of my scrubs because I was so worried to get it all near my face I had figured there would be some small amount of transfer but this was an excessive amount  Also why the hell are they advertising using this product bare handed if theres that much fiberglass transfer  Im currently wiping down my stove and my floors to try and get worst of it away and it looks like I need a shower and some tape in a small attempt to stop my bleeding hands  THIS IS NOT A SAFE PRODUCT FOR FAMILIES,1,6 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2024",True

B0CL5KNB9M,Fives No Jive,"A longtime PlayStation fan I had been putting off getting a PS5 until the three following milestones occurred  1 a reduction in size of the console 2 a reduction in the price of the console 3 a reduction in the price of games for the console  I thought that the introduction of the PS5 Slim last fall would spur my purchase but Sony didnt cut the price and even older PS5 games were still selling for 70  But finally during the Days of Play event this spring Sony knocked 50 off the consoles price  I didnt want the Spiderman or COD bundles not my favorite games  and I decided to act  Four years is a LONG time to wait to play a new RC title after all  So here are my thoughts on the PS5 now thats in my house  1 Setup is remarkably easy including wirelessly transferring game save information from a PS4 It did take me a while to figure out how to turn off the female voice heralding all my actions under Accessibility options  2 The PS5 runs like a champ So far I have not been aware of any fan noises or clouds of warm air exhaust spewing out  3 The DualSense controllers had weaker rumble than I expected It turns out that the rumble motors default to the weak setting if you have the controllers microphone enabled I turned off the mike and the rumble was back at full force but with more finesse than that experienced with the PS4s DUALSHOCK controllers If Im not mistaken the precision of the DS controller actually seems to improve my game scores  4 The new user interface is kind of a mess In particular leaving the POWER button off the Home page was a boneheaded move One of my first issues with the new console was  how do I turn this bloody beast OFF I wish that the controller battery gauge was on the Home page as well  5 It was a brilliant idea making the disk drive detachable The one problem I had with my PS4 involved the machines failure to read disks after a few years which I am guessing was an issue of a dirty reading head I sent the console to Sony to be fixed and it came back working perfectly in one week Now I assume I can just repair or replace the removable drive without sending in the entire console for repair  6 Now that the PS5 packs 1 TB of memory I was wondering how soon I would need to add more memory Currently I have plenty of memory to switch back and forth between a number of games including Ratchet  Clank Rift Apart plus several from the PS4 including WRC Generations Far Cry 6 and Resident Evil 4 as well as the Pinball Arcade One good reason I wanted the disk version of the PS5 was to minimize the size of game downloads to preserve memory  7 The audiovideo performance of the PS5 to play back DVDs and BluRays is outstanding And I was happy to find that the excellent Bluetooth PDP media controller I got for the PS4 works with the PS5 as well Yea  that made me feel better about spending 30 for the PS5s vertical stand instead  8 And some of the PS5 titles are FINALLY coming down in price Rift Apart and the latest Star Wars game for example  two AAA titles  are now available for a far more affordable 30  So if you have been putting off upgrading to a PS5 it may be time at last to make the move provided you can catch a special promotion  And to those who say Game consoles days are numbered I say  as long as many of us prefer to play games sitting on a couch enveloped in booming 3D sound and watching our dazzling bigscreen TVs   long live PlayStation consoles  especially those that serve as a 2in1 machine with builtin or detachable disk drives that also play DVDs and BRs",5,"551 people found this helpful","Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2024",True

B0CFPJYX7P,Tons of issues including horrible Amazon service,"I have owned every Kindle starting from 2014 when I got the Voyage Right off the bat the new Kindle Paperwhite has an overly yellow screen meaning that the light is significantly yellow Its not white its not even subtly opaque But YELLOW This is confirmed across multiple websites including YouTube and Amazon reviews on here  The other issue is that all new Kindles no longer support Apple computers due to the new MTP format that the Kindles are using This means that you have to go through the hassle of downloading a thirdparty application to do simple things like update new software and sideload fonts  Which leads me to my next issue sideloaded fonts are no longer properly supported You can still sideload fonts BUT every time you open a new book it automatically defaults to the Bookerly font even though you have saved a certain font setting This is extremely annoying  The next issue is that you can no longer download and transfer a book through the content settings on the Amazon website with new Kindles If you want to download a book that you have purchased Amazon has eliminated the ability for you to do that WHY Amazon service has no answers regarding this  Needless to say I returned this device for all of the stated reasons and guess what Amazon is going to take 30 DAYS to refund me my money I have to wait 30 DAYS to get my money back because Amazon has a defective and unsatisfactory faulty device Next time if I ever purchase another Kindle it will not be through Amazon But yet if new Kindles are this bad why bother  Now lets talk about aesthetics and design It seems Amazon is going backwards in their hardware The voyage was released 10 years ago in 2014 and if you were to compare them sidebyside one would think that the Voyage is the brand new model Aside from the having micro USB the Voyage has a sleeker more premium look with page turn sensors and better materials with a micro etched glass screen instead of plastic It also has a curved symmetrical design for better feel as opposed to a basic slab like the new Paperwhite  Lastly Amazon has done absolutely NOTHING to improve their software You still have the same limitations that you did since day one Kindles have the same limited margin settings limited font size settings and limited linespacing settings  I have a lot of sideloaded fonts that I would like to use but am unable to because theyre either too big or too small with the slightest increment in size adjustment Absolutely ridiculous Also the boldness options are too thick with slightest adjustment a font will go from too thin to too bold A total joke  GIVE US MORE FONT SIZES and OPTIONS AMAZON  My Advice  Im gonna give you my honest and most sincere advice regarding these new kindles STAY AWAY They are a disaster If you have the previous Kindle Paperwhite stick to that It is much better These new Paperwhites are defective From the yellow screens to the poor quality control to the font bugs to the MTP format its just not worth it The quality control is so bad that buying a new Kindle is like playing the lottery you most likely will lose and get a defective device with uneven poor lighting and heres the rub Amazon now has the most atrocious return policy in the industry I dont say that lightly it is absolutely despicable what the return process is like I couldnt even take the return to a local Kohls UPS store or a Staples store I had to take a day off from work because the only option Amazon gave me was to wait for a UPS driver to pick up my Kindle return at my house Insanity Talk about extreme inconvenience Then and here me outIt took 29 days from the day I initiated the return until the day it actually reached my bank account to get my refund 29 Days And I have been a prime member since 2008 This is how they treat their members What other business does that Nobody  If you absolutely must take a chance on these new Kindles then by all means go to your local electronic department store and purchase it there Because when you most likely get a defective Paperwhite you can at least go back to the store and return it and get your money back immediately  Lastly A word of Caution  I have a lot of books that I purchased from other websites and for the past 10 years I havent had any issues sideloading those books onto my Kindles BUT for the past year Amazon is making it very difficult to add sideloaded books onto your Kindle What I mean is that you can still sideload books via an application like Calibre or Send to Kindle but you have to keep your Kindle in airplane mode The moment you take your Kindle off of airplane mode Amazon will automatically and mischievously delete ALL of your sideloaded books on your Kindle YES you heard that right Amazon WILL delete your sideloaded books that are not purchased through Amazon once you connect your Kindle to WiFi This happens automatically To prove this you can go into your Kindle hard drive on a computer and you will see that the book file no longer exists for that particular book Other companies do not do this but Amazon is now doing it and its been going on for a year Its a known issue  all over the internet simply Google it and Amazon does nothing about it My guess is that they want you to purchase all of your content on Amazon They do not want competition Heed this advice because if you have a lot of of sideloaded books youre better off using another eBook Reader such as Kobo or Onyx",1,"252 people found this helpful","Reviewed in the

B0CFPJYX7P,Perfect little carryalong,"Im a relatively new eink convert having bought a trickedout Kindle Scribe exactly two years ago when the device was brand new Long story short I loved that device Literally to death After dropping it on terrazzo floors in SEVERAL airports worldwide not to mention the myriad spills at home on more forgiving carpet In fact I loved it so much that when the 11th gen Scribe went on firesale a few weeks ago I bought the cheapest version to replace my original recently nonfunctional unit simply swapping my old premium pen for the basic one Clearly I loved the device enough to buy it again I adore the ability to mark up pdfs the notetaking capabilities and that even with this extra functionality its still a very limited device that allows me to focus on reading first  What I dont love and never have The weight Its heavy to the point that I never used it if I couldnt prop it on something Which led to it being dropped A lot Which led to the original unit failing Not that it wasnt pretty sturdy I mean it survived repeated collisions with very unforgiving surfaces It even weathered some relatively large liquid spills on and near it despite not being water resistant  Now I just use the Scribe when I need to mark up pdfs like when Im gaming I can keep my character sheets on the Kindle or need something that can display larger printed materials Like RPG basic books or comics  Hence the new Kindle Paperwhite gen 12  My new device isnt appreciably different than my Scribe except in a couple very important ways The reviews dont lie The screen contrast is higher and in good light without backlighting looks whiter The device is much smaller and seems a touch slimmer Its also very importantly less than half as heavy which means its comfortable to hold in one hand while reading without tiring I dont need to set it down on things or prop it up which reduces the threat of drops When Im out in public I do have a cover for the device and because its so light you can hold it open like a paperback and it wont overbalance and fall out of your hand The screen given that its half the size of the Scribe seems to refresh much faster It also seems to load the store faster and settings menu navigation is measurably faster as well This is not surprising The device is newer and has less functionality The one thing that I have detracted a star for is the battery life I dont use the pen on the Scribe unless Im actually writing as it drains battery quickly When youre turning pages with the touchscreen however you get exceptional battery life out of the Scribe Not so terribly much on the Paperwhite Granted Im not the average reader 30 minutes a day is amateurish When I use the backlight all day Im running down the battery at least 10 on the Paperwhite if not more Not a dealbreaker by any means but gone are the days of not bringing a charging cord for a two week vacation as I did with the Scribe  I hear a lot of people make noise about the format AKA the Paperwhite doesnt have the extended lip on the side like the Oasis to make it easier to hold and that it doesnt have buttons Well I understand that personal preference is personal preference but Who the heck wants another point of mechanical failure on a device that goes through a lot of punishment in public I dont want my precious pageturn button breaking Ever And lets face it Thats why everything is touchscreen these days Yes you might have to clean the screen more often or bother to wash your hands before using your precious device which you really SHOULD be doing anyway but these arent exactly dealbreakers Another thing thats come up even in professional reviews is people accidentally activating the bottom button The question I have is HOW You need to alter your grip for leverage to depress it the device is so light The only other thing Ive mused on is that the Paperwhite is just a plain plastic thing It doesnt have the flashy aluminum backside of the Oasis or even the Scribe It doesnt look as luxe in the hand And honestly After the durability and weight issues Ive mentioned above I just plain dont care If Im in public my device is in a case anyway Im not an Apple person While I experience SOME evanity I dont think of my Kindle as a fashion accessory Rather the opposite as some people judge one harshly for going with an Amazon device in the first place Im here to read and you probably are too if youre bothering to read this review  All in all it took less than a week for the Paperwhite to become my favored reading device for its portability its weight and its utility I love the tiny thing I look forward to years of carefree comfortable reading without worrying so much about dropping my favorite notetaking device and general scratchpad the Scribe",4,"58 people found this helpful","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024",True
B0CFPJYX7P,Worth the upgrade,"Ive been using my 2014 paperwhite every day since the day I got it and love it so much I was reluctant to upgrade After 10 years the battery quality has diminished and the slow loading speed has become an annoyance so I figured it was finally time to take the plunge The new paperwhite is slightly larger with a bigger screen yet feels lighter The option to adjust the warmness of the backlight is an awesome feature Not to mention the load speed which is lightening fast All in all I am impressed with the new paperwhite and so happy I made the upgrade",5,"9 people found this helpful","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2024",True

B0CFPJYX7P,Wondering Why I Waited So Long To Upgrade,"I have a Kindle from 2014 which works just fine so every year when the newer version goes on sale I just convince myself to not spend the money to upgrade since this one still works albeit a little slowly in its older age Well this year I decided to finally just do it  mainly because my cover was falling apart on my old one but I figured if I have to buy a new cover then I will just go ahead and buy a new Kindle  I just got this in the mail a few days ago and I am in love I mean like over the moon sliding down a rainbow in love for so many reasons most importantly for all of the adventures it holds My future is so much brighter now because I am going to go to so many places through the books in my brand new Paperwhite I am SO excited Ive downloaded lots of new books just so I can curl up under a blanket cause its cold outside and use it more  It is beautiful I got the pink one decided to make it uniquely mine and bought an antique brown Fintie cover because those two colors go well together The case is perfect I highly recommend it because it has a foldover velcro side to keep your Kindle Paperwhite solidly secure so it wont slip out  I have attached a photo of both my Kindle Paperwhites side by side so you can see the difference in size The newer one is bigger but not bulky feeling Its lightning fast which is super awesome I didnt realize how slow my other Kindle was until I got this one So far I have to say that is my favorite thing about this one I dont find too much difference in the lighting from the previous version but maybe you will No comment on the waterproof claim because I will never ever have any of my electronics near water Learned that in Kindergarten  FYI if youre doing a tradein The 20 percent discount will not apply to your order if you choose the option with 3 months free Kindle Unlimited You have to buy the device only then purchase that separately Took me a bit to figure that out but a 20 percent discount is pretty good when you take it off the sale price Plus the 5 gift card doesnt seem like much but add it to the discount and it works out pretty well for a great new device The discount and gift card are applied to your account as soon as you submit the tradein request You dont have to wait to buy your new Kindle while your old one is making its way through the mail  I just love this I highly recommend buying it if youre thinking about it Happy reading",5,"8 people found this helpful","Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2024",True
B0CFPJYX7P,A few quirks but still great,"I should preface this by saying this Kindle is my third paperwhite Ive also had the Fire and a regular Kindle before that and my Kindle is in my top 5 of my beloved possessions  However Im a bit frustrated with the setup on this one Some of this is operator error  Ive been trying to download too many books at a time which keeps freezing up the system So thats on me and why this version currently gets 4 stars instead of 3 But when I first registered my device which went smoothly and then opened up my library I discovered all but a handful of my books of which I have well over 2000 were showing up as unread or partially read even though I currently only have 2 unread books At first I hoped that the system would catch up this was prior to me downloading books onto the new Kindle as my content library on Amazon showed the books correctly marked as read but that didnt seem to happen so I manually went through and marked them all as read To be fair I found a few errors in my organizing in doing this so was able to fix a few things Still it was a frustration and time consuming I should note that I did check for and ran the update when I first started the Kindle too  After two restarts to unfreeze the Kindle again probably my fault from trying to download too many books at once plus a third one when the screen suddenly prompted me to register my device again after having already done it and having 775 books already downloaded I am going much more slowly on downloading so hopefully the rest of the process will finally go more smoothly  One other quirk was a couple books that had been placed in collections suddenly showed up in the uncollected folder Not sure if I somehow accidentally removed them from their collections dont see how though or what was going on  Oh one other quirk I nearly forgot was that my library was showing that I had 42 library books even though all had been long returned So I also had to rereturn them as part of the process of getting this Kindle ready to use  Im guessing this next concern is because it was trying to download books last night but it was fully charged at around midnight and when I checked it about 8am this morning it was down to 7 battery charge  Im hopeful all will be fine when all is said and done but what I thought was going to be an hour long process is well into the double digits of hours with work left to be done Ah well Im sure once its all done and I can focus on reading this frustration will simply be an unpleasant memory  Update All is forgiven with the above noted issues as it is easier to use the screen is nice sized so easier to readjust wonderful",4,"8 people found this helpful","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024",True
