B0B1VQ1ZQY,Great as a Kindle ereader but very limited functionality as a tablet Alexa no longer works,ive fire tablet max several months initially really loved wanted ebook reader large enough screen read kindle books plus wanted functionality personal assistant plus wanted something could go online first fire max provided well ebook reader great larger screen easily read books kindle library im happy go online fire max like amazon tablets uses amazon silk browser apps amazon app store many apps would like use available like dropbox adobe acrobat read pdfs internet security many othes bluetooth ive thus far able pair laptop fire tablet computer pair connect fire max tablet even numbers match computer tablet theres way share files except usb havent tried yet cant speak whether works however files want view fire max tablet pdf files theres way read without pdf viewer thats downside well limited apps amazon app store also theres way add antivirus firewall adblockers either going online extremely limited without security one would like finally amazon alexa initially godsend could reading article ny times washington post app available app store ask alexa definition word would give fire max stayed article screen provided streamless reading experience since could choose alexa respond even device locked could wake morning ask time tempweather would respond immediately could set reminders alarms would give reminders even wasnt using fire max tablet screen locked alarms wanted set alarm morning worked quite well issue unfathomable reason amazon designed cover fire max actually cover speakers sound greatly reduced sometimes hard hear even miss cover open close opposite sides work well speakers however since alexas latest update days ago functionality gone frankly id fire tech team came update ive come conclusion amazon intends phase alexa function personal assistant amazon fire tablets much microsoft windows phased cortana functioning personal assistant windows big mistake imo first thing noticed update spoke alexas name textbox much like one youd see phone sending text using messenger send message pops im reading article washington post nytimes etc ask alexa word definition person mentioned article screen reverts alexas text screen immediately customer care team says thats see say alexa responds think idiotic however since screen leaves news app order get back article reading close alexas new text screen go back home screen tablet select news app go back article reading way much hassle make seamless reading experience frankly fast use oldfashioned dictionary functionality lost perhaps importantly alexa longer works device locked dont know dont use tablet times day screen inactive cover closed since want protect screen tablet spills accidental falls something falling prevent cracking breaking getting liquid say coffee water close use closing automatically locks device sure used beginning alexa would still work back even cover closed also device automatically locks period time set certain increments min minutes option lock device period inactivity would want security first keep fire tablet max always active would take alot battery power means id keep plugged time constantly recharging wears battery purpose tablet mobile device keeping plugged makes difficult use especially charging cord less ft long id say like inches thats really feasible probably good battery however since alexa longer responds lockscreen doesnt respond questions reminders alarms longer work either unless device active im using rather defeats purpose since set alarm wake im sleeping using amazon fire max tablet meaning locked alarm wont work set reminder birthday take garbage doctors appt whatever longer get reminder unless actively using tablet defeats purpose reminder remind device make sure im using fire max tablet time reminder alarm scheduled get set clock alarm paste sticky note set like unlock tablet alexa remind take pill someones birthday etc already reminder sticky note alarm clock goes ill read sticky note need alexa also functional personal assistant either alexa fire tablet max im guessing tablets essentially neutered functionality personal assistant im guessing although customer care denies shes phased tablets cant understand frankly update looks like phone tablet go help section example gives specific instructions help alexa mobile phones echo devices tablets though update meant different device devices got theres way undo heres literally stupid responses ive gotten customer care see text box pop say woke word aka alexa theyve told disable handsfree alexa well means way use alexa ask question give command etcwait itis use text box message solution even made modicum sense doesnt dont want see text box use text box would make thats see use sure thought one literally laughable idiotic second solution ive told factory reset alexa original state maybe shouldnt tell amazon tech specialist solution wont work bet people reading guess yep factory reset wipe data setup device apps installed including alexa begin update alexa comes embedded amazon fire max software updates automatically matter hours even days youll reset great way literally ruin tablet maybe amazons plan keep replacing fool thered second purchase oh mentioned amazon alexa embedded amazon fire max tablet software much like cortana used embedded windows embedded microsoft office works office applications theres way uninstall reinstall even uninstall suppose could disable im sure cant function personal assistant shes disabled oh heres final bright solution one tech gave tell alexa exit show mode tried several times tell tablet isnt show mode alexa exit something isnt enabled kept insisting though unlocked device told alexa exit show mode alexas response sorry cant help agent asked rotflmao alexa exit show mode alexa sorry cant help alexa officially dead personal assistant amazon fire max tablet im guessing true tablets cant speak know functionality gone fire max tablet ive called complained told ive said avail theres way roll back update previous version guess update intended alexa apps mobile phones far ive gotten answer looking new help section solutions issues listed specifically mobile phones whereas previously case would initially given fire max tablet stars without alexa im downgrading star opinion buy real tablet want personal assistant dont buy one alexa buy one either siri google assistant one customer service agent tried tell theyre good know people ipads android tablets use personal assistant time problem amazon would remove market ie tablet functioning personal assistant beyond comprehension therefore longer worth money tip iceberg apps suspicious full ads abound amazon app store functional apps like antivirus security software nowhere found cant even find starbucks app tablet could recommend whatever potential functionality glorified kindle reader kindle ebook reader shame amazon tablet real potential compete tablets market instead amazon shows shortsightedness taking away even limited functionality last update dont even get going customer care clearly outsourced planet country solutions part package representatives barely speaking intelligible english read lame scripts laughable examples already given using tablet several months ive downgrade review star

B0B1VQ1ZQY,Great productivity device,update ive using fire year got prime day still like lot bit heavy relaxed reading also got fire hd th gen year prime day indeed significantly lighter even thought size difference two fairly small width taller portrait wider screen landscape nice keep using keyboard came bundled get keyboard keyboard awesome wider allows keyboard comfortable touchtype want attached keyboard recommend ive used keyboard extensively really great accidentally touching touch pad occasionally unintentionally change typing location also noticed annoyingly slower rendering icons home screen occasionally icons disappear wait reappear couple seconds dont recall ever seeing regular android device fire os issue apparent slower main reason decided write update sd card issue reviewers mentioned thought others issues set card internal essentially quite like bigger internal space everything including apps dangerous reason longer newer versions android unless zillion apps really need bigger internal space apps really set card portable memory instead apps card media files etc decide types files put safely remove card access another device like laptop thats called portable choose kindle app prime movies etc download card people need expanded memory media makes sense safer also good control gets stored sd card vs internal storage setting card internal isnt reason people issues today first time issue others complained card supposedly unmounted fire asked reformat would bigger problem set internal rather portable shut fire removed card mounted windows windows told problem card scan fix windows showed fine issues trouble copying folders card windows returning card fire still showed screen formatting card im wondering fire tends show screens shut else card somehow marked needing format super weird thing said format portable memory without removing anything doesnt formatting card mean erasing showing blank start fresh going format however fire likes format return original folders need copy back anything working fine apparently would reformatted decided swap using portable internal probably every time unmount eject card get message wont really erase everything reformat unless opt change want use card okay card situation happened probably happened function writing card another function update dismounted thus interrupting write windows fix think card issue almost certainly nothing particular card others comments correct ive using new highquality samsung pro plus card overkill fire tablet sale card issue surfaced trying updates appstore seemed frozen still problem appstore fire good state may good idea reboot occasionally probably hadnt rebooted month also thinking maybe trying update broke normal functionality could biggest suspicion fire os july checked updates even though showed last checking today said tap install update everything froze eventually went back updater said update rather bunch gibberish suggested pieces still downloading broken button installing initially happened able install update rechecked updates showed updates found check button reappeared normal seems fine fact os still shows still shows july today aug get usual message system updated secret undocumented thing old update reinstalled perhaps fire os update update builtin component like apstore thing appstore still seems hung page update

please please normal updates let users know update let pick update controlfreak apple want using device trying update shutting remove corrupted card thats asking trouble want plugged keep hands problem amazon devices well okay youre gon na force update whether like please dont want cause lot grief let people control awareness device needs updated guess even minor update seems case kindle fully functional pretends since fully functional quits processes unexpected quits cause corruptionscrashessd card issues otherwise good device truly im still happy love whale background initial review got productivity bundle super pleased needed something take notes classes also touch screen drawing great amazon appstore onenote squid great notes experience matter app use pen paint app tried worked
